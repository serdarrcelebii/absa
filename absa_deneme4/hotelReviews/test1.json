It looked like an airport. There were hundreds of people! There were easily 80-100 people in the sitting area with luggage. There were about 50 people in line to check in. There were people everywhere. After waiting 20 minutes I finally checked in, though when I saw the sign that said \"portable smoke detectors available\" I hesitated. The room was a decent size for NY standards. The 2 double beds were not the worst I've slept on but not the best. The heater/AC unit did not work- fortunately it was spring and I didn't need either. The phone didn't work in the room or in the common area near the elevators. There was no ice bucket and I had to wait 40 minutes for one. The blow dryer didn't work- my replacement never came. The window opened- I was shocked- but there was no screen. The TV had basic channels. The room was very old and outdated but I will say it did not smell at ALL. The bathroom was so old and pretty nasty. Layers of dust and grime on everything. Not a very good cleaning crew here! Only thing offered was shampoo and bar soap. When I called asking for a wine opened I was told they are not a full service hotel. There are a few little stores in the lobby. There are 2 restaurants but I did not eat at either. Not the worst hotel but far from the best.

I grew up in Brooklyn and now live in Miami, Florida. My husband had never visited NYC so we extended a ministry trip to Yorktown Heights to include 3 days in Manhattan. I researched reasonably priced hotels and found The Pennsylvania. I was quite pleasantly surprised at the centrality of the location and the level of service we received. Our room was small but had been newly remodeled. The room was clean, warm and very quiet. Beds comfortable and linens clean. Heating unit worked well. Never tried the A/C as we traveled in March and it was cold and rainy. The bathroom was also small but quaint. Towels exchanged every day. When you realize the hotel dates back to the 1910's you chalk some things up to charm and go on. The lobby is HUGE and quite busy. Loads of tourists from all over the world convene there. Also available in the lobby is a business center and tour desk. Customer service was optimum and we were treated very well every time. Central location is its best feature. Across the street from Madison Square Garden & Penn Station; one block from Macy's; within walking distance to the Jacob Javits Convention Center; and about ten blocks from Times Square. Easy access to subway and if you need a cab, you can get one right out front. If you need a cab to the airport, the concierge desk will arrange it. They were also very helpful in steering us around the area. Had the weather cooperated, we would have had an amazing NYC mini vacation.

As you will know from other reviews the hotel is quite run down. Rooms are dark brown with insufficient lighting and not in any way renewed for decades. Off course there was neither fan nor air condition in the room. The socalled business lounge contains of two coffee machines, two computers of old age and generally old fashioned cafe furniture. The carpet was totally worn down. The two computers was at all times occupied by kids and young people who used them for Facebook for hours. The hotel doesn't seem to care for the travellers using mobile devices as smart phones or iPads. The only way to get your own device online was by cable in the room at USD 11 plus taxes. And we even paid extra for free wifi and a superior room! This had been confirmed twice to our travel agent thus making us choose HP because of the location. Breakfast is served in the socalled business lounge and consists of rolls, croissants, jam and coffee plus a watery orange cordial. No yogurt, no fruit, no juice, no milk, no cheese, no meat - nothing but rolls, jam, thin cordial and coffee. We even got a \"special deal\" paying 208 per night for a double. Or ... no ... perhaps we didn't. Because when we arrived we were told that the rate differed from day to day ending at 262 dollars per night. Plus taxes of course.

I asked if there would be a price reduction and was told that since I had prepaid there was nothing that could be done about the price. It was late and I was tired so I just let it go.

When I requested housekeeping I felt that I was a bother but was told they would be right over. Needless to say they never appeared that night. I was so distrubed that I slept in my clothes. The next day housekeeping did come but my request to change to a king room was once again denied.

I booked through expedia.com and it was pretty much the cheapest option with flights etc for our requirements to stay in New York city. Never having been before I chose it for its price primarily, then location...flying into Newark Airport it was a 30 minute train ride away to Penn Station (New York not Newark!!! That was my mantra...). I did indeed read all the reviews before travelling and after booking and oh dear I was petrified. I contemplated booking elsewhere but was talked out of it...thank God. First of all the location is great which seems to be universally agreed...and it couldn't be better for a first timer to the city. Easy access from the airport, cheap train fare...out of Penn station and straight across the road to the hotel. No need for taxis, buses etc... It's 10 minutes from Times Square walking and well basically central to everywhere...perfect. The hotel check-in took about 45 minutes yes...but we checked in at 3pm ( check-in time ) and so it was expected to be busy as its a huge hotel. Yes we were tired and amazingly hot (temperatures were unseasonably warm ) but you know it has to be done so why moan about it???? On our way out an hour or so later there was no queue whatsoever! The lifts are plenty and always available quickly.... the long hallways are a step back in time with the art deco doors but it's history folks....does it matter? Our room smelt very clean on entering and I was pleased to see it was FINE!!!!!! The carpet felt clean as it could be and I had no problems walking BAREFOOT... The sheets were spotless, crisply laundered and the bed was comfy....I shared with my slim daughter (I'm not so slim) and it was ample big enough. We both slept soundly and comfortably. The sheets appeared to be changed every day of our stay...they were fresh as a daisy and the sharp ironing creases definitely looked new each day. The bathroom was clean as a whistle...yes it had mould on the ceiling and the bath enamel had come away around the plug hole but OH MY WORD does this matter???? We paid peanuts and we weren't staying in the PLAZA after all.... The furniture was dated, the view not great but again I'm not sitting in my room all day...if thats what you do in New York then stay elsewhere.

If you want a good English tea ask for black tea/ or breakfast tea and put in your own milk etc...as good as PG tips ). Yep it costs a couple of dollars but you can sit there to your hearts content as we did every morning.

We were met by the Bell Captain on arribal who had all our keys ready, which was very appreciated. On inspection of the rooms however we had been allocated 18 twin rooms and 4 single rooms but booked 9 tripples, 9 twins and 4 singles. We needed accommodation for 9 extra people! I returned to the reception, spoke to the manager to sort this out. She informed me that they were going to put \u2018cots\u2019 in 9 of the twin rooms. This was just not acceptable as once this started to happen it was very evident the rooms were simply not big enough to fit extra beds in and still have floor space. One room looked as it it had one massive bed covering the whole floor. I returned to reception and told them this was not going to work and asked them to find us 9 tripple rooms. The hotel issued us with new rooms for 3 of those allocated on another floor but after inspection, they were the same rooms but on a different floor. I returned the keys and asked them to try again. The hotel finally managed to find 2 tripple rooms but had to squeeze the extras into the rooms we had. We still needed to find rooms for 4 students so asked the hotel if they could give us an extra two tripple rooms. They refused and said that beds were being sent up to the rooms we had. One of our lecturers had enough of this situation and gave his own room up for 2 of those students and went to find another hotel to check into. We then convinced the final 2 students to bed share with their friends in the rooms they had as it was just pointless to try and find any other solution to our problem as it was now very late in the evening and students wanted to go to bed. In a nutshell we asked for and paid for 9 tripple rooms, we eventually had 2 and the rest had to sleep in a cot or bed share. One member of staff stayed in another hotel.

The room was SO small, limited space in the wardrobe for 2 people, there was a chair but with no dressing table. The beds had only 1 flimsy pillow each, the walls were dirty, peeling & actually covered in squashed bugs, & the ceiling had mould growing all over. In the bathroom, there was more mould on the ceiling, the bath was dirty & all cracked, you had to let the water run for over 10mins before it became hot & it literally was either scolding hot OR cold, no warm water, & the vent was out of use & covered up by a plastic bag. There was no safety deposit box in the room so we had to keep our personal expensive items in the safety deposit room all the way down in the lobby which was so inconvenient. Also no free wifi, the charge to use the wifi service in the hotel was so expensive so we would have to take our laptop down the road & sit in McDonalds to get free access. The amount you pay for the hotel you would expect to get free internet service included. Ridiculous. What really let the hotel down during our stay was a Dog show they had on. We wouldn't have cared as we love dogs, but we weren't told this event was going on. They let all the dogs stay with the owners in the hotel rooms & the room next to ours had this small yappy dog which barked ALL night long & because the walls were so thin it was really loud. Also opposite our room was a stage door which all the dog owners would access & I was woken up at 5am by an owner training his dog yelling comands \"stay\" \"sit\" which continued for over an hour. Not only this but the whole hotel STANK of dogs, not want you expect at a \"decent\" New York hotel. Was like living in a zoo. Me & my friend complained about our terrible night due to these dogs & the staff were so rude & non-understanding. They refused to do anything about the situation, & refused to give us a refund so we could relocate hotels. So I asked to speak to the manager who could only move us the following night as they claimed they were \"fully booked\". The staff didn't seem to care about their normal guests & all attention went to the dog owners. I refuse to ever stay there again as it was a terrible experience.

Peeling paint and huge holes in the walls Huge stains on the marble shower was at about chin level and was so forceful it actually hurt to use it The wind from the forceful shower pulled the curtain in to the shower area so it stuck to you while bathing.

The tub stopper was not connected to the chain, so impossible to empty the tub. We figured that housekeeping would help with this issue, but nope, returned to find a tub filled with the same water...

I stayed at this hotel once before - 8 years ago, - and had hoped that by now the rooms would have been refurbished a bit. However it's still the same old worn-out carpets, bad paintwork and dusty surroundings as last time. The lobby is impresive, and there is a couple of nice places in the hotel to enjoy a drink and a meal in the evenings if you don't feel like verturing out after a long day of sightseeing. In terms of the other postives, - the hotel is in an ideal location in mid-town Manhattan, a 5-10 minutes walk from Time Square, 5 minbutes from the Empire state building, and 5 minutes walk from the main shopping streets of New York. Penn (train) Station is directly across the street, - take the red subway line No 1 for easy access to the Downtown Manhattan sites (Financial District, Ground Zero, and Battery Park, - where you board the boat for the Liberty Island and Ellis Island tours, etc.) Also, it's quite a safe area at night. Overall the hotel is good value for money for the location, - and would do the trick if you were in town for one night for a concert or something like that, - however you really know (and are made to feel by the staff) that you are in a sub-standard place. Won't be giving the Pennsylvania any more chances, I'm afraid. If I am going back to New York again I will pay a little extra for somewhere a bit more upmarket.

On arrival the lobby was extremely crowded with huge queues for check in, OK I can except that, there was a major dog show happening at the garden and they had a lot to contend with, what is completely unacceptable is the surly attitude from the staff, but I could even excuse that due to the stress of the amount of dogs and people they were trying to manage. What is completely unacceptable is after leaving the lobby (which looks great) and getting out of the elevator onto my floor, finding carpets torn walls scraped, fixtures hanging off the walls, carpets stained (and I haven't even made it to my room yet). The room was small, even by NYC standards, it should have had 2 queen beds and instead we got 2 beds that were slightly smaller than a regular double. The walls had holes, the carpet had stains, everything looked and felt dirty. The sheets had cigarette burns in them. I can honestly say I have stayed in slum hotels in China and India and left feeling cleaner than staying at the Hotel Pennsylvania, I am amazed they get passed by the NYC health authority. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location for Madison Square Garden. Take my advise, choose the Hotel Affinia one block down, it is about 1000 times better. Oh, and to the owners / manager of the Pennsylvania, why not save money on printing special room keys for dog shows and putting your name on the city maps and put that money into renovating this complete dump?

I learned about this place but was very leary after reading reviews that included bed bugs, etc. I took a chance because of the good reviews and was glad I did. First tip - I initially made my reservation through bookit.com - my go-to cheap travel website but upon checking the hotel website a few days prior - found that they offered a special $10 cheaper that included breakfast. - Let me clarify that breakfast is just juice/coffee/tea and one choice of a pastry - but still - included makes all the difference. I changed my reservation to the cheaper one easily. The lobby was huge and really nice and includes a couple restaurants, souvenir shops and tvs with news channels on - and lots of couches to sit on if you arrive too early for check-in which we did. The bellboy lent us a door key so we could use the bathroom on premises. The people at check in were very nice and very helpful. Of course once heading up to our room on the 10th floor - you definitely can see the carpets need replaced but they were decent enough. Historic vault doors were cool on the rooms. The room itself of course needed an update - worn carpeting and mushy bed. But I stripped down the sheets and didn't see any evidence of bed bugs (peppery matter) - and the shower - tho also could use some work - worked - and had plenty of towels, shampoo and soap. I did have a problem with getting the shower completely turned off and called to have the problem handled. Within 5 minutes someone was at our door and I appreciated that. They easily fixed the problem (the one shower spigot needed tightened, which can happen anywhere) and left in record time. Problems don't bother me - them not being handled does. In this case, it was quickly handled so no problem. Tho I wish it felt a little cleaner - not well dusted around the edges and worn furniture, etc. - we were only there one night - so it completely did the job. The location can't be beat - right across from Madison Square Gardens and just a few blocks from times square and near a ton of shops and a mall - and the service was really great and within a block or two of several different subway stops. FYI - no internets in room - except for a fee - and they will store your luggage at $4 - but they can also include that in your room check-out invoice.

How wrong i was though..... On arrival it took approx 20 mins to check in, the staff were friendly and answered all our questions and allocated our room. We booked a Penn 5000 room - which i would deffo reccomend you do as its onlya few extra \u00a3's and you get access to the Penn Site ( a room with 2 internet PC's and tea/cofee makers, and breakfast which is just bagels and pastries but was unlimited and did the job the hot drinks were available all day, every day!) and its my understanding the rooms are bigger and slightly better than the standard rooms. (plus you get a fridge!) Our room was clean, but basic its not a 4* hotel its about a basic 3 BUT its clean and location wise cant be faulted - the showers take some working out but they do work and our shower was great, the beds were made daily, bins emptied and the rooms tidyed - what more do you want when you are only in the room overnight??? Yes the decor is dated, yes some of the rooms need updating - did it ruin my holoday NO as im not really bothered what colour the carpet is or if there is some pant flaking off a corner when im in NYC! Yes, when you come out of the lifts onto the floors there is an element of'the shining' as the halls are quite dim but also bear in mind there are 1700 rooms in the hotel, if you want a personal service then go stay in a smaller hotel. each floor has its own team of cleaners who are there most of the day every day and are lovely! Check out took less than 5 mins, we left our bags in the secure area for $4 per bag - BARGAIN and when we had to leave forthe airport we decided to make our own way there by train - Pemm station is directly opposite and for $12.50 each it took us into Newark Airport station in 25 minutes - MUCH cheaper than the taxi's or pre booked transfers and quicker as no traffic jams! The pre booked transfers will collect you 5 HOURS before your flight to allow for traffic delays, we left the hotel 3 hours before the flight and checked in trouble free. One piece of advice for UK travellers - dont take your hairdryer (save the suitcase space) as its different vaultage and yours will be naff - we had 2 in the room a crappy bathroom one but also a very good mains one.

This description wantonly flies in the face of the British Trades Descriptions Act. It is certainly busy, a place where visitors will flock, because it is in the bargain bucket range of establishments. That does not mean that the place has to be scruffy - which it is - dirty (it is the only hotel in which I have stayed in nearly fifty years of travel where there have been piles of litter in the corridors) and generally unloved and unkepmt. Built in the 1920's and fabled in the hit song by Glenn Miller (Pensylvannia 6-5000 is the hotel's telephone number) it has seen far, far better times. As Miss Bette Davis once neatly observed, \"what A DUMP!\" The vast lobby is unwelcoming and austere - as was the woman on the front desk (you wait in a long queue and no apologies are offered or smiles given) who was clearly trying out for the title of Ice Queen of 2012. The corridor on the 15th floor was bestrewn with discarded pizza boxes, and beverage holders, and a few used tissues. The walls are grubby and smeared with paint marks (is someone actually going to do some decorating?) and my room had chipped and ancient furniture and a bathroom in which you could, with some difficulty, swing a mouse. The bed linen was clean, however, and there was a view of the Empire State Building from the window, one of the few good things to say about this truly ghastly experience. Returning from a dinner with frinds, a homeless man had installed himself on a bench in the lobby, and was snoozing with his drink propped between his knees. We only spent one nIght in this sad shadow of a hotel - if someone was able to spend a good few million on it, close it down to refurbish from top to bottom, and then re-open it after a through restoration project, the Penn might, just might, be worth a visit. As it is, it is a clasic monument on how not to run a hotel. What makes one shivver is that the Penn is a historic building, a riot of art deco style - but clearly no-one in charge loves it or respects it. It is one step up from a doss house.... and, if you want to see what a few dollars will do, walk around the block to Eighth Avenue, and discover the re-modelled New Yorker, which is everything that a tourist's hotel should be - kindly and attentive staff, a great little cocktail bar off the lobby, clean and modern rooms, efficient service.

It turned out much better than I expected. The check in was quick and the staff was wonderful.

He noted that all the double bed rooms were smoking and not good for my allergies so we kept the king. He then showed me great places to go in NYC (that we have never heard of and it turned out to be a great recommendation) and couldn't be nicer. We were on the eleventh floor and I truly don't understand the references to asylums and \"The Shining\". Yes, it was not extremely well lit but for an old hotel it was fine and acceptable. We walked in our room expecting the worst and were very pleasantly surprised. The brown carpet is worn and flat (reminds me of outdoor carpet) but the room was a good size (better than the Sheraton on Times Square at 3 times the price) and very clean. No musty smell. The bed was a true king size, the TV was a flat screen, we had a nice sized refrigerator in the room, two end tables and a closet. The closet was narrow but you could hang things in it and just kind of slant the hangers a bit. The bathroom was clean and well appointed with a shelf over the sink and toilet, a wide sink, a tub/shower combo and excellent hot water and water power. The hotel supplied soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shoe buffer, and shower cap plus a hairdryer along with 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels and a wash cloth. All linens were clean, no stains and no bed bugs were found (a big concern in NYC). The bed itself was on the hard side and the king sized pillows were a bit flat for me but after a long day in NYC I slept like a rock. I would recommend bringing earplugs for sleeping if you are a light sleeper. City noises (siren, car honking, etc.) and bathroom noises can be heard, but I bring my plugs everywhere. Even the best hotels can be noisy. So, the wall paint could be freshened up, the carpet renewed, but for under $100 a night in NYC it was fantastic. We stayed at the Waldorf one time and even that hotel needed to be refreshed so it was definitely a good deal. Complaints would be the restaurant attached to the hotel is way over priced (for a good breakfast at reasonable prices would be Lenny's which is to the right of Madison Square Garden less than a block away), the TV was a bit wonky as the volume was at full blast every time I turned it on and it took some finesse to turn the TV off as it kept coming back on (I kept the off button down for a bit longer than normal that did the trick), but that's it. We really enjoyed our stay there and I will definitely be bringing my family back. Now, one side note is that we talked to some other guests and their experiences were not as nice as ours so I guess it really is a luck of the draw but from our recent experience it was a great place to stay. Be nice to the staff, don't be expecting 5 star for 1 star prices, appreciate the fantastic location (we walked to Broadway/Times Square, the garment district, and the fashion district) and I hope you have as nice an experience as ours.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wolverhampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cstay here its ok.\u201d", "Author": "Lisa M", "ReviewID": "UR123095936", "Content": "I stayed hear just before xmans 2011.

The wait time to get checked in took us an hour and half, because they don't let anyone in to their rooms until 3pm. That was the first red flag. We go upstairs to our floor, and walking out of the elevator was like entering a scene from the movie the Shining. All I could hear in my head was \"Redrum... Redrum\". The floors were filthy and there was a red couch in the corner that was torn to shreds. The doors themselves looked like something that would be in the basement of the Titanic. They were metal and rounded and vault like. Our room was even worse. There was one thin polyester sheet on the bed, with two flattened pillows that might as well have not been there. The radiator either blasted out heat or didnt work at all, and dont even get me started on the tv/armour. All of the knobs were missing on the armour so you couldn't even open it to use it if you wanted to.

It was a bit of a spur-of-the-moment Sat/Sun trip in January and the cost was a lot less than where we usually stay (Hilton, Sheraton). It was in a convenient location across from Penn Station and just a few blocks from Koreatown, (an area of Korean restaurants on 32nd) where you can get great Korean bbq cooked right at your table. The lobby is beautiful -- massive with marble floors, chandeliers, leather seating and a large bank of elevators -- and the outside of the multi-story building looks old and charming (I believe it's from the 1920s). Our room, however, was another story. The brown flat carpet was dirty all around the edges of the room, as was the edge of the bathroom floor. There was mold on the bathroom ceiling and door & some chipped paint and cracks in the walls and ceiling throughout the room. But despite the bit of mold and the bit of dirt, the room did not smell (which we have experienced in the past on an East Coast driving trip when we had to stop without reservations -- so this was better than that!). We did check for bedbugs and there were none; the sheets were clean and so were the towels though my 16-year-old daughter didn't trust the sheets so slept on her sweater on top of the pillow. Beds were uncomfortable and there was a dip in the middle. Flatscreen TV was nice though the remote didn't work so we had to get up and change the channel -- but at least the cable continued to work! There is 5 minutes of free internet then it is $9.95 per day. There was good quality soap and shampoo provided and the shower, sink and toilet all worked well in our room though the shower head was about at my eye level (5-foot-4 inches), but we're all short in my family so it was OK! There is a Lindy's (cafe) in the lobby, also small coffee shop with a couple tables, a restaurant (steakhouse, I believe), a large gift shop, a newsstand and several tiny gift shops (just t-shirts and mugs) plus TV screens showing news in the lobby and in all the elevators.

I decided to go with Hotel Pennsylvania based on its location and pictures I saw on its website. And, it worked pefectly for our needs. We took a bus from suburban DC and it dropped us just a few short blocks from the hotel, so we didn't have to drive into the city. And, the hotel is right across the street from Penn Station for those traveling by train. Access to the subway is right there as well. Madison Square Garden is right across the street, Macy's is just around the corner, local restaurants are all around (Andrews is a great diner in the next block!), and Times Square is just a few blocks away. We walked everywhere: from the hotel to Times Square where we bought tickets for various shows from the TKTS booth (be sure to at least check out these discount booths for Broadway and off-Broadway shows), and walked to our off-Broadway show, and the ones on Broadway as well. Rockefeller Center was about the same distance from the hotel as Times Square, and our kids took the subway from the hotel to Central Park. The room itself was in need of a remodel: old carpet, loose headboard. But, there was a flat-screen TV and a small refrigerator in the room.

Stores, restaurants, Midtown attractions - you're in the center of it all. Don't stay there. This hotel is more than 90 years old, and it shows. It's not a charming historical hotel, but a huge and badly maintained dump. The room I've stayed at had stains on the walls and the carpet was weird, the TV was an old CRT, and some of the wiring was carelessly done. Lighting was inadequate, room was almost always dark. The bed seemed old as well, not very comfortable. The window, which overlooked one of the folds of the hotel and not the street, was thin enough to allow a lot of noise in, which is a problem in the city that never sleeps. The bathtub had a huge ugly stain around the drainage hole, and the shower head was uncomfortable. That said, I wouldn't call Pennsylvania hotel unsanitary - no bed bugs, the bed sheets were clean and so were the towels. Another lackluster aspect was the customer service. Due to unforeseen circumstances my girlfriend needed to book the hotel for me, and she has done so with her credit card since I didn't have mine on me. When I checked into a hotel in DC with the same situation, they were friendly and just asked me for a 100$ security deposit, which I was happy to provide. At Penn, they refused to do that, claiming it's the hotel policy and they're not to blame it wasn't made clear when I ordered on third party website. The supervisor even had the audacity to answer the question \"Where does it say that I have to have a credit card\" with a vaguely threatening \"You don't wanna go down that road with me\". In the end, I was only allowed to check in after my girlfriend photographed her cc and drivers license, and sent it to them by email (How very secure). I understand that this hotel is usually one of the cheapest in Manhattan, but seriously, it doesn't worth the 20-40$ a night you'll save if you're a tourist.

The fridge was a former \"mini bar\" and had a dismantled lock on it. Cute. Note we paid an extra $14 to get these frills and I would recommend it. A continental breakfast (danish, OJ, coffee, bagels) and the staff replenished the supplies right up until it closed at 10AM and then leftovers after that.

Hotel Pennsylvania was the cheapest available, and was priced below many hotels in less popular destinations, so it was a real bargain at $130. And the location is one of the best in NYC. This grand old lady has a huge old fashioned lobby with the largest reception desk I have ever seen. Despite the large crowd and long line at check in, we were processed promptly and professionally. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of our stay. The room was tiny (although comparable to other budget tourist hotels in NYC) and the king sized bed took up most of the floor space. The walls and carpet were not clean. Electrical outlets were old and worn out, and some wires were exposed. The bathroom was out of date, very small (could only fit one person at a time), and had mold on the walls. Climate control was not effective - on this cold rainy late autumn day we had to open our windows to moderate the heat. Because of the room temperature, we had to keep the window open a crack at night, which enabled us to hear street noise. Unfortunately, we did not sleep well. The continental breakfast included in our room charge was served in a very small over-crowded room with too many people to be comfortable. We skipped it and went out to eat. I have stayed at much worse hotels in small towns along the highway as I have travelled around the country. This hotel is very cheap relative to the NYC market.

THIS HOTEL WAS FAR FROM IT, I WILL ADHERE TO TRIP ADVISOR FROM NOW ON!! The lobby seemed ok, the Chritmas tree and decorations anyway, the staff were nice enough, so we made our way to our 3 double bedded superior room, out of the lift we came to a corridor, dark and dingy, the doors had apparently the original valet door stuck to it from the 1920's, they curve out and remind me of a jail door, my sister commented it looked like something out of an old asylum or something, THE DIRT WAS LEFT OVER FROM 1920'S by the look of them, anyway on we went to the room. 3 single beds, the maid was changing the beds and cleaning! so we waited, we could see the matresses, stained and very uninviting, the clean sheets were threadbare and well stained with what could only be described as various bodily fliuds, the outer cover was not changed, and on one of the beds there was excrament on that outer cover. The light shades torn, the lamps covered in dust, the television and cabinet you could plant veg in the dirt, the window would not close, we asked for someone to come sort it, it didnt happen, we slept that night sitting up, laid on top of the bed on the towels, (oh the towels were spotless funny enough) full clothed in coats to keep warm, the damp all down one wall was terrible, i have returned home with a chest infection after sleeping in that den. Now the highlight, THE BATHROOM, this was awful, ok old you can handle, this was filthy, the plughole was covered in hair, rust, mold, the paint not just chipped, peeling off, the bath had been painted, white and grey, yes I did say the bath, it was cracked and jagged, we had to put a towel down to stand on to shower. The toilet had been bleached, though the seat not cleaned, sorry I dont want to see other peoples pubic hair or any other remains. Other people have posted photos, I have taken loads and apologies I cannot upload, one lady checked in and straight out again as they could not move her, a couple were moved 4 times, they were there for 5 nights, one guy paid $1400 for 3 nights to find remains of a pizza in his bed and when he complained was told if he didn't like it move on, I will my two sisters complained, after no joy, I had the travel company move us, i was lucky as i put a lot of business through them, some people may not be, my sister cried when she saw a couple with small children and a baby trying to move, they had been bitten by flees or bugs. We had to stay there 1 night, we found a local shop and bought cleaning stuff just so we could try and feel comfortable whilst we were stuck there and did the best we could, this was not just 3 sisters moaning, other guests stuck there did the same. I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS HOTEL IS STILL OPEN, THESE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ARE NOT A BUNCH OF WHINGERS OR OCD CLEANING FREAKS, THIS HOTEL SHOULD BE CLOSED DOWN, STRIPPED OUT, SCRUBBED AND HAVE A MAJOR REFURBISH, THE ROOM IS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD SEE IN A FILM, USUALLY INVOLVING A CHEAP FLITHY ROOM THAT WOLD BE USED FOR ILLICIT LIAISONS, OH AND THE TAXI DRIVERS FIGHTING OUTSIDE, PHYSICALLY PUNCHING EACH OTHER AND IN THE LOBBY, WE ACTUALLY FELT UNSAFE.

I was attending the Duran Duran concert at Madison Square Garden that night. I went on-line and searched several hotels in the area. The hotel room was about 280.00 plus tax and it came to about 335.00 with tax. I thought that was a little pricey, but compared to others in the area it was the cheapest.I figured it is NYC and close to many tourist attractions. I also picked it because it was close to the concert and for the train to head back up-state. When I first entered the lobby there was a huge line for check-in. I think my friend and I waited about 30 minutes. The lobby area was busy and seemed nice.It probably was the best part. There was a lot of people sitting around waiting. We finally checked-in and were sent to the 12th floor. Once we got the 12th floor it became very dark and dingy looking. The doors were these huge former bank vaults from like 1919. Sure, that was cool, but try opening it over and over. They weighed a ton! We finally got our our room, 1256. It was like a cave! It was dark, old, musty, and just plain ugly. The room needed up updates for sure. The carpet had a lot of mysterious stains. The first thing we did was check the bed for bed bugs. It was ok, but I heard others were not so lucky. The bed was hard. I like a firm bed, but this was like concrete and very low. I did not sleep well. The bathroom was small and I did not want to touch floor. It had some various hairs laying around etc. The toilet and shower were close making for sitting on the toilet a tight fit. The view was into what seemed to be more hotel rooms. I just feel that this hotel that is a bit out-dated and for the money they should really do some up-dates to 2011-2012. We were invited to the club room/lounge and that was where we had breakfast. They had bagels, muffins and coffee in a small room with like a lot of people. This hotel was just ok for a 1 night stay if your just going to a concert or something near by. If I was a foreigner who saved up a lot of money to come to NYC and I was staying here, I would be really really disappointed. If you are staying longer in NYC, I would try something else like the Marriott or Doubletree mid-town. I stayed at those as well for a weekend trip and they were better. We checked out around 11.a.m and wandered around the city till our train. For an extra 4 dollars you can keep your bags in the basement luggage room, which was helpful so we didn't have to carry our bags around the city til our train. I guess I like more up-dated modern hotels, and this was just dark, old and lacked something. The lobby, the website make it look really nice, but once you get there.. it looks very different.

Again, we went downstairs to use a computer from a internet room, paid the use for it, made a reservation in another hotel (obviously talking to the Hotel Pennsylvania manager first), and we left for a decent and clean hotel. We contacted Hotel.Com and told them everything (probably they recorded every phone call), and they told us they would reimburse only part of it, which they did. How can they charge for one night if they had no clean room for us? Wasn't our fault, we made a reservation, paid in advance and full, showed up on the day we said we would, but they had no clean room. ...Again, obviously the responsibility for all of this wasn't mine, Hotel Pennsylvannia and Hotel.Com are the ones responsible because they charged for a service they didn't provided.

Having read the reviews on here I was really concerned that the hotel was going to be awful and was ready on arrival to complain and request other rooms. On arrival the check in took 15 minutes, all of the desks were open and the line (around 40 people) moved very quickly. I have stayed in many other cities and hotels and have waited much longer. The lifts where fine, they were all in working order and we never had to wait during our 6 night stay. On leaving the lifts the floors were very dated. It would not be fair to say they are dirty; they are old and do need renovating but our floor was cleaned each day (we saw this several times) and was fine - not good but fine. We stayed on the 15th floor - the hotel has 18 floors in total - which avoided much of the noise issues but we could still hear alot of noise if the window was open so we went crazy and shut the window at night. The room was clean and tidy however it was old, needed refurbishment and had seen much better days. The paint on the walls was cracked and the bath room needs a refit. HOWEVER we could not find any bugs, dirt, mold or any of the other things listed in other reviews in our room. The TV worked fine, the sheets on the beds were clean and fresh and the towels in the room were also clean (and all were white so everything would of shown up). The matress on the bed was new as where two of the units in the room. Everyday during our stay the room was cleaned (and hovered), the beds made and fresh towels provided. Each door to the room is getting on for 100 years old - each has a sign to prove that they where fitted in 1919 - but ours was secure and could not be breached (we tried as we had read a review that here that said differently). During our stay we felt safe in every part of the hotel that we went to. The staff we spoke to where helpful and we got the impression like they knew about the press the hotel gets and were doing the best they could with what they have which is a very old building that has not had any investment. Where we were at the recepion we saw several people who were making comments about the rooms they were in and each was offered another room without question - I have stayed in other hotel where best offer I got was a refund and had to find another place to stay. I slept fine each night; the location was really good - as most people have said. To sum up; if you wish to stay in a hotel that is modern, newly built and has top features then book into a 4 or 5 star hotel and pay the extra cash. This is a two star hotel and gives a two star service. Yes it needs a serious amount of money spending on it to bring it up to moden standards and I am sure there are rooms that are awful but our stay was fine. Being perfectly honest, this hotel was 20% cheeper than any other we found in the same area and I would much sooner save the money to spend on seeing NYC. And despite the condition of the room we were in it for less than 7 hours a day which was spent sleeping - if you go to NY for the hotel room then stay at home; it is a truly fantastic city and needs to be seen. One final point - if you are traveling as a group (4 or more) I would consider renting an appartments - costs are about the same but you will get more for your money - I would do this if I went to NY again.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bankok", "Title": "\u201cbudget hotel very central located\u201d", "Author": "traveladdictedBankok", "ReviewID": "UR120171147", "Content": "five nights in NY could be very expensive, but the Penn is the perfect place to stay.

We arrived last Thursday at 3pm, it took 40 mins to check in. We were greeted by George, who was very friendly. We asked for a room on a high floor (to try and avoid the traffic noise) and one with a view - we were given room 1513. Now ok, the room wasnt draped in silk, but it was more than ok. The room was spacious and very clean (not a bed bug in site) the bathroom was a decent size with soaps, shampoo and kleenex tissues for our use. The hot water was plentiful, if anything there was too much of it. The bed was the same size as a uk double, quite firm but comfy. You only get 1 pillow each, but you only need to ask and you can get more. Tip - take ear plugs - you are in New York and the 'whoop whoopin' sirens (which i enjoyed) will wake you even on the high floors - but really.......what do you expect............this is not the countryside. The Wifi is only available in the lobby (reception). $2 for 30 mins, $3 for an hour and $6 for 12 hours. I used this service without any problems and was able to skype home for a fraction of what a normal phone call would be. Just be aware that it can be busy so if you are skyping take a usb phone to cut down on the lobby noise. The location of this hotel is fantastic. We were able to walk to most places of interest to us, and to be honest the only time we got a taxi is when time was getting short. I would strongly recommend everyone to check out the New York Pass website. I can honestly say, it saved us a fortune, but also opened up other tourist attractions which we hadnt originally thought of doing. New York itself is a wonderful place to explore and you will make many great memories there........if you feel you have found yourself a bargain on booking, then you probably have. We paid 382 GBP for 3 nights and would and will go back again. Tip - there are 4 (very) local bars that i recommend for both food and drink starting closest first :- Blarney Rock (out the front of hotel, turn right and first right100 yrds) Stout - next door to Blarney Rock - free Wifi here. Mustang Harrys - (out of front of hotel, turn left, about 300 yrds) Mustang Sallys - bout 10 doors down from Harrys. Think its always good to know what it on your doorstep. The hubby has just reminded me to mention that if you dont have a New York Pass then avoid the New York Skyride (situated in the Empire State Building) - waste of time and money. Also, if you dont want to miss any premiership football games, its good to know that the 'legends bar' is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. (out the front door, turn right and right again) walk to the Empire State is on your left and Legends is opposite. They open at daft o'clock. We were there at 7am on Saturday morning!!!!

Firstly I have to say the location was good for us, right opposite Penn station and about four blocks (ten mins walk) from Times Square, this is why I've rated it 3 stars/average. However the location was the only plus for us really. We booked early and got a good deal online for a Penn 5000 room, this is a room on a particular floor where you get access to the Penn 5000 club room with internet access, light breakfast and TV, this deal implies that you are getting a great room etc. Our room was bad so I cannot imagine what other rooms must have been like. Our room was old, damp and the bed wasn't a queen bed it was tiny, like an old double bed it was so small. A pet hate of mine is damp, dirty sheets and I asked staff to change our sheets for this reason. Whether you stay in a 1 star hotel or a 5 star I believe that you should be given a clean bed with clean sheets - end of! The aircon was old and very noisy, the floor itself was noisy and they put us in an adjoining room and because the hotel is old with thin walls, we could hear absolutely everything going on in the room next to us, including a crying baby night after night, poor thing! In general the hotel was just really disappointing I've stayed in cheap hostels that were cleaner and had more attentive staff. The staff really were rude, perhaps it was the time of year? Who knows! The night that topped it off for us was when we'd been to see a show, the one night during our stay that we came in quite late for us and I decided to take a shower, it was just before 1am and we had some crazy maintenance man (who could have been anyone intially!) knocking on our door telling us that the room downstairs \"had a god damn leaky ceiling and to have a shower with the god damn curtain closed\". I was very annoyed at his attitude towards us and pointed out that only morons shower with the shower curtain open! Obviously I had it closed and there wasn't any water on our bathroom floor etc etc! I firmly believe that if the room below had a leaking ceiling there was no way we could have known/avoided this! I rang reception to complain about the man and his rudeness and that they should perhaps maintain the rooms/plumbing better etc and not shout at guests late at night etc, the female manager wasn't interested and told me that I was wrong and that their maintenance man hadn't said any such things to us and somehow it was our fault that the shower was leaking, through the walls! I couldn't wait to get out of this hotel, the service was ridiculous! Breakfast in the \"Penn 5000\" room was basically a muffin and tea/coffee from the very basic tea maker. I did worry a little because the reviews on here were not good just before we left for the states. I would in future pay a little bit more and stay somewhere else and just get a taxi to the station because this hotel was quite awful. I would never stay here again or recommend it. :(", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAncient and run down, but location is awesome.\u201d", "Author": "x10white", "ReviewID": "UR119567760", "Content": "This hotel is very old so it's been worn down by all New York tourists for about 100 years.

If you want to read a review about 5* luxury accomodation, then read no further. If you want to read about a large hotel , situated in the heart of tourist New York, then spare a few minutes and read on. To be honest, it's not that bad. Its a huge hotel 1700 rooms I was told, with a massive turn over of guests every day. In general the hotel has a tired feel about it, but it also has character. The reception hall/area, did resemble a railway station, with the ammount of people passing through and line for checking in can/does get very long When we checked in there were 5 people behind the reception, so the line moved at a steady rate. The lady that checked us in was very helpful, polite and curteous, which is how we found all the staff we encountered during our stay. The corridor on our floor did have a musty smell to it, but there were no windows which couldnt have helped. Yes it wasn't the brightest of rooms, but I think the height of the New York skyline had something to do with that. The carpet had a bleach like stain on it, and some of the paintwork had seen better days. The curtains needed replacing to be honest, but did the job. The air con was a bit suspect and quite noisy, but worked. The bedsheets were crisp and clean, the bathroom was tired but clean enough, we recieved clean towels every day. We took a look at the higher floors (we were on the ninth) and it looks like refurbishment is on going, from the top downwards perhaps.The hotel came as part of a package, so I dont know the actual cost of our stay. From our experiance I think the Penn was adequate, especially If you think how much time you actually spend in the room. The hotel is situated in prime position for the New York tourist, with a subway station directly outside. Madison Square gardens is opposite, The Empire State building 2 or 3 blocks away, Times square 10 minutes walk, or one subway stop uptown. The rest of Manhatten 10 minutes on the subway away. OK its not the greatest but its more than adequate. Oh yes, if you are from the UK, the lady in the City Perk cafe in the hotel makes a good cup of tea! We encountered a problem with the internet in the business centre, which the manager sorted immediatly, by giving us a key to free internet access, so no complaints there!

After one of those rather long haul delay arrival experiences one can have at JFK, we were looking foreward to our stay. At entrance we had to line up and wait about 45 min. (!!) till we were served. The staff was okay, but sadly not friendly. The lobby is huge and looks realy great for an entrance, they obvious put alot of efforts to keep this part of the hotel clean and shiny. Then...we entered our room at the third floor. The corridors to the rooms are poorly lighted/ dark, the corridors carpets show vissable stains, it looked more like entering a floor wich actualy has been closed for the last 5 years, left alone due a allergy to any kind of cleaning. The roomdoor is the original one from the once oh so luxury past of this hotel (bck to 1919!), but looks more like entering a prison in the modern world. Then we entered the room, I have been travelling thru Africa, and other third world countries, where you know you sometimes have to accept low luxury standards. But this room looked even worse...... Lets start with a more deeper view: The sheets in the beds showed visable stains, and i am not sure if they were realy fresh...their smell did not even came close to soap. The carpet in the room looked like it had a maximum 1,5 minute turbo cleaning leaving 60% of all dirt very visiable behind. This is the first time i actualy felt very uncomfortable, better said dirty, walking barefeet on a hotel carpet. (and no...i am not a hygienic-weenie) The room had no romance at all, dirt und dust was visable on lights, chair and in the bathroom (second hand hair smiling at you from the walls after \"some kind of cleaning\" had taken place....) The windows were dirty, on the inside, the \"museum-suspect-looking airconditioning system\" was dirty. The curtains had visable stains, and looked somehow not cared for. On the wall was one painting only with again visable pieces off. This room looked like abandoned, and had no friendly welcome aura in the most minimum way. A small fridge was \"parked\" somewhere in a corner, the television showed cleaning stripes like you see them when you clean your television with a wet towel after 10 years of dusteating...to be short....it looked like we entered a room for the homeless (with all respect for these ppl) who cannot afford anything more then a bed and a once a year cleaning. Noise....came from the neighbours till 3 am. The walls are like paper. A few loud fist drums from our side on the \"paper-walls\" finaly brought some silence We left this hotel after one night and found a better place two streets away at the Wingate hotel, and that even for half the money!

My friend and I had booked a room with 2 beds for 4 nights in the Hotel Pennsylvania. We arrived from Vancouver at 12:30 at night and waited a long time to be able to check in. We finally got the key, went upstairs, and found that the room had only one bed. We went downstairs again, back in the line, and after another long wait received another key. So up we went, and again found only bed. Down again, back in the line-up for the third time. We were told that we would have to talk to the manager. I called his number and it rang over 20 times before we picked, up,. He told me that the hotel was full. I explained again that we had not walked in off the street - we had made a reservation from Vancouver weeks before. He then talked to the staff person and we received yet another key. This room had 2 beds but they were unmade and the housekeeping staff were just starting to clean. It was now 2:20 am. So we had to go downstairs and wait until the staff person made the beds. We then returned upstairs and lay on the beds in utter exhaustion while the staff person cleaned the bathroom and vacuumed the floor. Finally at 3:00 a.m., we were able to get to bed. Then in the morning, we noticed that there was at least \u00bd\u201d of water on the bathroom floor. We told the staff person in the hall who burst out laughing, and said that she reported the water several times but no one in management seemed to care. She suggested that we call downstairs so we did, but no one came to fix the leak for the next two days. The housekeeping staff would clean up the water every morning and it would just fill up on the floor again throughout the day.

Let me start of first by saying I am in no way picky about hotels that I stay in, as long as they are clean I am happy, after all I don\u2019t go on holiday to stay in the hotel room. But this hotel was beyond a joke! We waited in line for about 40 minutes to check in, but we didn\u2019t let this dampen our spirits to much as we were just beginning our holiday (road tripping around America). Our excitement could only hold so much, as when we got to our room we were absolutely disgusted as to the shape it was in. There was large chips knocked out of the walls, stains everywhere, the carpet was disgusting. The bathroom had damp and mould growing everywhere, and I am not being carried away here, literally the whole bathroom ceiling was covered in damp. We went back downstairs to complain and get another room, but reception was chaotic. So being in New York for one night and having plans to meet friends we decided we would get our room changed when we got back. We then tried to ignore the hotel for the rest of the evening and ventured out into New York to enjoy ourselves. When we returned to the hotel the feeling of dread had came over us (which should not be the case on holidays) and so we marched to reception, which still had a short line at 1:30am. We informed them about the shape of our room and that we wanted it changed to another room, and that it was a disgrace they even gave it to us. The receptionist was ignorant as to why we had left it so long to change the room (As I said we where only in New York one night and we were not wasting it at the hotel reception), she then tried to make the excuse that the hotel was old! I have stayed in buildings that would be over twice as old, but they clearly knew how to clean, paint and repair! I informed her that I had paid a lot of money for a room and that I expected it to be to a certain standard, at least being able to sleep in the room without feeling disgusted would be a start. She then continued to let us know that lots of people are always complaining and changing rooms, which really made us feel bad about choosing this hotel, and this doesn\u2019t really say much about it when lots of people have to change rooms. What annoys me most is if someone moves out of a room for a perfectly good reason, why not then fix the problem rather than pass the room on to the next victim. We eventually got out room changed, but alas the second room was not much better, though it was cleaner and had less damp. I would not stay in this hotel again, and would not advise anyone else to do so. It was expensive for one night, and I understand that it\u2019s pretty central in New York City, so I tried to let that be the reason for the expense. But there is no excuse for the room being in a condition that you would not let your dog sleep in. DO NOT STAY HERE!! Pay a little more and stay at a better hotel!

It bills itself as the \"largest hotel in NYC\" and it certainly looks so - tons of people coming and going all the time, which can be a problem. There's a guard at the entrance of the elevators but honestly they couldn't care less about who gets in and out, so street smarts apply as you go into your room. The room doors at least have keyless/deadbolt locks. If I had to describe this place in a single word I would say \"functional\". Not luxurious, not upscale, simply functional. The hallways look sketchy and in desperate need of a paint job. At least the room was clean and with a straight view of the Empire State Building as a bonus. Guest service is barebones and, as it seems to be painfully usual across hotels, there isn't free wireless Internet (there's for-pay wireless, but only works in the highly trafficked lobby).

A person would really think that this would be a great hotel, but this is where it all ends. It is just to get you in! When we checked in, the first thing they told you is that there is a $50 dollar early check out fee and if you wanted internet service you would have to pay and asked for a credit card. I did not think anything of it because from what I have seen so far everything look great. When we try to go to the elevators there is a gentleman there (like a guard) who stops us and says you cannot bring up you own luggage and that a bell-hop must bring it up via the service elevator. Again I did not think much of that either. So we waited for the bell-hop who begins to take our luggage to our room and we left to go to our rooms. Once out of the elevator everything changes! The smell of old stained wet musty carpet is overwhelming. Walking down the poorly lit hallway with falling plaster, falling paint chips everywhere you look, doors CHAINED CLOSED, doors busted open. The longer I walked the madder I became, but it does not end there. Once to our room door which was filthy, paint peeling, marred we opened the door to a room that has not been renovated for many years! I'm guessing 50yrs! The room had a dark brown carpet that smelled old and musty, the carpet does not look as it has been changed in fifty years. The door bolt was literally just hanging on the door by 1 screw. Old bed, old tube tv with a broken remote held together by black tape. A hole in the wall where an electrical socket used to be, an electrical socket that does not work. Four person room with towels and wash cloths for two people. Old, marred, and scratched furniture, no clock, broken hair dryer, a view of garbage from our window which has bars on them. Now as I sat there I started thinking why they are charging a $50 dollar early check-out fee, why a bell-hop takes your luggage, why the lobby was so nice. It is all to get you in and keep you there. When you read this you may think that maybe I am too picky or high maintenance. This is not the case at all. I have stayed in many hotels and motels in my life. This hotel is simply disgusting!

If you don't go back out the doors a get a cab and ask them where to find a good hotel, of if you have a laptop make a right out the doors you came and go to McDonalds which has FREE internet service and look for another hotel.

The tub was dirty and need new grout. Wife bought Clorox and cleaned it. 2nd. The leg fell off the sink. Maid said it always falls off. It was left on the floor for seven days. 3rd. The shower handle stripped of and could not shut off or start the shower. Service man came tightened if and never came back. 4th.The tub water dripped for seven days and has nothing to do with controlling the shower head water that also dripped for seven days.. 5th. A clicking noise was constantly behind the bathroom mirror. 6th. The hair drier never worked we turned it in and it was never replaced. 7th. The ironing board was missing and we got one stuck open all the time, since it was broken and would not fold. 8th. The curtain rod handle was off the curtains for seven days. 9th. The shade on the small desk fell of the frame since it was held on by tape that let go because of the heat in the room. I guess it was just small items that happen in a $200.00 a night room. It was great when some of the staff was friendly but many time they were annoyed that we had a problem. The standard answer was \"It is like that all the time.\" One of their techs said about the elevator, \"You should be happy that it is working sometimes.\" The best thing was the location of this Hotel. Across the street is Penn Station and Madison Square Garden that we wanted to see but it was closed for remodeling. The subway entrances were almost on every corner around us. The bus system is great and the driver were the most helpful and friendly. Many people helped us on the bus with suggestions and even gave us maps. The bus as well as the subway were really clean and looked new. If you are a senior riding a bus it is only $1.10 a ride with a transfer to another bus withing a two hour period. To bad we didn't learned about this until the last day. We found the #1 subway takes you to the Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty. Make sure you pre-buy the tickets and they guide you past the people waiting in line. That also applies at the Empire state building. Show them the pre printed papers and they pass you on. Brooklyn Bridge.take the #15 it takes you right to the bridge. We only walked to the first arch and we walked back sitting down several time. Good thing it sprinkled some rain to cool us off. Remember this Eight Avenue runs up town which is North one way. Seventh Avenue rungs Down Town which is Sough. one way. All Streets run East to West.most are one ways. We never saw an accident and all the people drive like maniacs and use their horn constantly. People cross the street before its time to cross since they only have to look one way but nobody gets hit. Supper Shuttle is a great way to get to airport of the hotel. Best i think is JFK. But if there is two of you of more take a Taxi. I never rode one but during the heat way I almost took one. The show we took in was \"CHICAGO\" we have seen the video and this was just a good. They are seldom sold out and the cost is only $60.00 and many offers are made in Times Square for tickets at lower prices. From the hotel Macy.s is only two blocks north. HUGE department store. it has three Starbucks on different floors. Take up a whole city block and six floors. It has a Mc Donald's and two bakeries as well as pizza all on different floors. If you go to Visitor Services they will give you a Discount on anything you buy, because you are a visitor. There are so many restaurants to choose from. Forget finding a Mexican one of a good Chinese in that area. Restaurants on Eight avenue near the Broadway shows are plenty. We are at a place called \"PIETRA PASTA\" WOW. What great pasta and the Parmesan Chicken was so great tasting. It came with vegetables, french bread rolls with some sort of garbanzo dip. We split the dish since my wife was not feeling good about her stomach. But after tasting it she devoured it. A down pour of rain started right after we entered the restaurant and every one outside was wrapped in plastic bags or umbrellas. Times Square Area was one block up and we went to purchase candy at the M & M Store that is three stories high. It was now 10 o'clock in the evening the hordes of people walking to and from now where and not knowing just where they were going was a sight to see. We were like sardines jammed together just justifying to make a head way. We walked all the way from 50th ave to 33rd ave. and it was just a fun time. We stopped and ate a Gelato and \"The Bread Factory\" A 24 hour restaurant that we liked. Finally Make sure you have cash or a MET card with money on it if you take a bus. They do not take Bills. Again for the location of this Hotel it is great and no \"BED BUGS\" Just don't look under the bed. For value I still like \"Motel 6\" just $39.00 all over the country.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgood location\u201d", "Author": "DDDDDDDDDDDDDD_11", "ReviewID": "UR115847451", "Content": "i whent to the penn hotel last week...as a travel agent i had to visit a few hotel but choose to stay at the pennsilvania.. all the reviews for this hotel were negative...but i find that this hotel offers a great value for your money...verry good location...close to everything... peen subway station verry close to the hotel...the room was basic but clean...AND THERE WAS NO BED BUGS! the staff was verry helpfull... i recomend this hotel for anyone that whants a good location in NYC at a verry resonable price...", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi", "Title": "\u201cBest possible location but an Average Hotel.

Upon my arrival to my Hotel Room, I met the door unlocked and wide open !!!! That was the first Red flag. I was scared and upset and called the Front Desk . I asked for a Manager and spoke to a nice Manager named Mark, He changed my room. I felt scared for my life meeting the door of my Hotel Room opened and not Locked . Second Red Flag was day Two, July 22, 2011, the entire rug on the floor where the TV and the window by the Ac was was soaking wet.. I had to keep my shoes on inside m y room all the time in my room. I told the Maid outside the same day even brought her in the room and showed her . She said they would take care of it. She will tell her Supervisor. It did'nt happen. The night before my departure, Saturday Night, at 9:30pm is when a man from engineering knocked on my Hotel Room door telling me he was from engineering coming to look at the Ac and th water soaked Moldy rug. . I was not letting any Man from any where come in my room while alone. I told him I was leaving the next day on Sunday and it was no use to come in tonight . Do it when I leave Sunday. Whywould engineering come so so late at night , and I was out shopping all day. I reported this on the second day of my stay and only the night before m y departure engineering comes to look at the situation. An Operator named Rose was Rude when I called to tell the Manager named Mantoo about the Rug being soaked and smelling moldy she hung up on me .She had me on hold for a long time til the Manager finally came to the phone after calling back 4 times and she would'nt answer the phone seeing my room number displayed.... I went downstairs and spoke to Mantoo the Manager. .I told him this was not my first stay but it will definitely be my Last !! I told him of my Terrible stay I was having and why Operators are hanging up on guests.

It was there the afternoon of Saturday when I got some money out of it. It was there every day until Sunday Morning. I called Guest Services told them , they called Security which this man just toook my name and address .That's it !!! No Report was filled out or anything.

She did not tell me who cleaned my room that day my money was missing she said because of the Union . I had $400.00 stolen from me and She and Security for Hotel Pennsylvania , acted like they did'nt care as long as they got their money for my Hotel stay.

Water leaks and stains everywhere. Shredded carpet throughout. Peeling Paint. Terrible smell. AND THESE ARE THE GOOD POINTS!

We were further discouraged when we went to our rooms (we thought it was supposed to be 2 double beds in each room) and found we had a single double bed in each and the rooms were on different floors (they were supposed to be next door to each other since we were traveling together). After further review, we found that our plan coordinator may have made a mistake on the reservations, so to correct it, we went to the front desk. Of course, no other rooms available with different bed types. So, we settled for a roll-away bed in one (no room for a roll-away in the other). We attempted the next day to upgrade to a 2-bed room again and were once again told (in a wonderfully hateful tone) that there were no rooms available and to check back after 1:00 PM and she would note my room as requesting a double double room. Based on the check-in line when we returned (more on that later), we chose to avoid the lines and just make do with the accommodations we had. In my room, the A/C never really cooled the room. The roll-away bed was horribly uncomfortable and there was black in the caulking of the bathtub/shower. Our room was pretty small, but expected that with it being in NYC and it was actually larger than our traveling partners'. Throughout our stay, there was generally an extremely long check-in line in the lobby. The restaurants were overpriced and service was horrible. I recommend eating at locations outside of the hotel if at all possible. The gift shops were ok, though nothing different than you find lining 7th Avenue. I don't recommend wasting your time on their continental breakfast or their \"business centers\". We were never able to get breakfast because in the room that had the continental breakfast was always horribly full of people and rarely did the coffee machines work correctly or at all. The first day, there was trash overflowing from the trashcan right next to the food and beverages. If you want tickets to a show, don't use the service they provide. After waiting 20 minutes with one person in front of us, they told us their tickets started at $130 for a Broadway show. When I told them that was ridiculous and we could find them online cheaper, the lady argued with me and said that our seats would be bad if we got them online and theirs were \"good seats\" (we ended up in the 8th row orchestra for less than $70 with tickets we found online). Requests to the front desk are worthless by phone and not much better in person (as outlined above). We called on our last night there because the maid service had not put a flat sheet on the roll-away bed. The man on the phone told me they would send someone right up with the sheet for us. We fell asleep waiting and never received it. Overall, it's a clean place to stay and in a great location. But if you're like us and going to be walking all over the city with very busy days, you might want to find a different location to stay so you can rest well. I can't say whether I would stay here again; it's very convenient to almost everything, so it's hard to find anything better than that.

Next we found a mysterious blue substance at the bottom of the bath, along with multiple cracks, possibly another result of frustration? When we had our showers the water temperature would vary from boiling hot to extremely cold. You had no control over the temperature. The beds are extremely basic and squeak when you make the slightest move. No wifi in the room but you can reach Penn station's wifi for a fee.

You just come out of Penn Station and there it is, across the road. If you want just a room to sleep, then this is a convenient place, though not cheap. The drawbacks: The rooms need refurbishing very badly. The room I had looked dated. The bathroom towels seemed from yesteryears. The breakfast was just breads etc. and juice/tea/coffee kept in a small room. There was no coffee/tea/drinking water in the rooms. The ice machine was empty at 11.30pm. The plus points. It was easily accessible and close to Times Square (12-15 minutes walk from the hotel), where all the fun is at night. Lots of Theaters there and full of life. It feels as if the city does not sleep. In case you want to see the shows, make sure you book tickets at least a day in advance. There is a counter in the hotel premises that helps in arranging tickets for the shows, apart from arranging other things eg. transport. (Maybe they charge a small commission but maybe its worth it as it saves you the bother of going out and buying it yourself). The Grand Central Station is also a 10-12 minutes walk from the hotel in case you want to travel to other parts around New York and has excellent eateries too. The Sight seeing operators (Hop on - Hop off bus) stand outside the hotel itself and sell the tickets then and there. It included the cruise around the Statue of Liberty. (timings of the cruise were 10am,11am,2pm and 4pm so you can plan) These are valid for 2 consecutive days. Step out of the Hotel and you are in Shopping Paradise. In case you go to Macy's, a block away, make sure you get your discount card from the visitor center of Macy's which was 10% when I was there.

Our room was tiny with a view of a brick wall and was in need of a thorough clean. After our first night we attempted to leave the hotel to discover that the door would not lock from the outside therefore leaving all our valuable at risk. We reported this to reception who promised to send someone straight away. After an hour waiting in the room we reported the problem again only to be told that someone was on their way, a further hour later, sick of wasting our holiday in New York, we packed our bags and arrived at reception to be greeted by a very rude gentleman. He was totally uninterested in the problem and the fact that we were unable to secure our luggage. We demanded the hotel store our luggage whilst we went out and it required us to escalate this problem to the manager who was able to secure us a different room later that same day. Unfortunately, prior to leaving the UK, we had booked a further stay at the Pennyslvania later in our holiday. On our 2nd arrival we were allocated a room with a broken tap which could not be turned off. After a further room move we were allocated a large, but very unclean, room... the bathroom was covered in hairs which certainly didn't belong to us and the carpet was filthy and covered in cigarette burns.

The hotel room doors do look like prison doors as stated in other reviews, but they are doors?! Who cares! The only complaint I really had was the room service. For half of the week it was fine, clean sheets every day, clean bathroom, new towels etc.. but for a few days we would return back to the hotel at about 4 -mainly to get out of the intense heat NYC saw last week-and the room still hadnt been done!

Some things should have been already replaced, such as the air conditioning and the TV. As far as cleanliness is concerned, no issues at all: our bathroom was perfectly clean, and so were the linens. Not even dust trace on the furniture. It was a convenient choice for us. We came from JFK by train, only with two backpacks, for maximum mobility, so we just had to cross the street after leaving Penn Station. The concierges were not the most polite guys you wound find, but I wouldn't care either. They have a good shuttle service back to JFK - it was expensive, but worked well. I think it's more interesting to spend $ enjoying the city, so I don't see a point in spending much with hotel. This is not a real good one, but it is ok.

Each time I have stayed with groups of friends and or my husband in this hotel. The only exception being in Sept 05 when I was lucky enough to have won a trip and we stayed elsewhere which was way up on 57th st and we spent so much money on cabs getting to and from places. The hotel is so central you literally are within walking distance of everything. You step out the front door look to your right and there is Times Square, right across from you is Madison Square Garden. Penn Central Station is right underneath you. Manhattan Mall is right at the back of the hotel. You literally can shop around the hotel and go back and drop your bags to your room and head out again. We preferred to save our money rather than stay in a top notch place and use this money for more shopping for us. Okay so The hotel is quite dated in terms of decor, parts of it are redecorated, some of the staff on the reception desk need some refresher courses on customer service but these are all niggly details. We honestly spent so little time there only to drop bags off and go to sleep that it didn't bother us. You have the helpful staff in the concierge area, the bellboy is always very nice, the staff downstairs who hold your luggage are very nice. So it all balances out. There are plenty of delis around the hotel to grab food from. I would personally recommend a visit to Little Italy for a meal it is fabulous. I would also highly recommend a trip to Jersey Gardens, I much prefer this to Woodbury Common as I find with Woodbury Common all the outlets are individual buildings spread out so you literally need to map out where you want to go and if you are travelling in a group you might spend half your time waiting outside places on other people and not getting everywhere you want to go to yourself. Where as with Jersey Gardens it is literally a massive mall everytime I go I get there before 10am, at 8pm at night I still havent gotten around to every shop but have to go home! Dont forget to show your passport at the info desk where you get a book of coupons for various stores which comes in handy. I would recommend this hotel to people on a budget wanting to buy lots of shopping who aren't too fussed on the 5 star quality of rooms but rather having a place for your head to hit the pillow. You will save so much on cab fares being so central all the high street stores are literally around the hotel and Times Square is a 2-3 min walk away. I have gone to numerous Knicks Games in Madison Square Garden each time also and would highly recommend you doing this if you know what dates you are travelling in advance book through The Gardens website. If you arrive at the hotel and aren't satisfied with your room, go straight to reception and ask to be moved they will do this straight away. Tip the bellboy he will be helping you with your bags checking out!! and the doorman if he hails you a cab, he will get you one quicker each time you need one. The Empire State is literally a 5 minute walk from the hotel I would book tickets for this and anything on else with viator they do better deals then paying at the desk when you get there, you get a voucher to print off and come with you but you need to know what date range you will be visiting.

All the hotels were fully booked in our range ($200-300) so we made a reservation through Priceline for $275/night at the Hotel Pennsylvania. We knew the rate was high for this hotel but it was the same with all the other hotels and this was the only one available. We checked in at 5pm, once we got to our floor, we started to worry about the condition of the hotel. It was old, which shouldn\u2019t be a problem if it was well kept and maintained through the years but this wasn\u2019t the case. It was old, dirty and poorly lit (probably to hide all the flaws). When we got to our room, we were just appalled. It was so old and looked horribly dirty probably because it was soooo old. Paints were peeling, the telephone was covered in dirt, and the washroom.... I have stayed at motels/inns before but I\u2019ve never stayed at a hotel room where you have a washroom designed like a public washroom. It reminded me of my high school washroom. The toilet was a tankless style with a flushometer valve, exactly the ones you use in public washrooms. We didn\u2019t ask for a different room because we were only staying one night anyways and there\u2019s no guarantee a different room would be any better. We decided to spend the least amount of time in the room to minimize our discomfort. We stayed out all night, came back around 1am, slept and checked out at 7am the next day. When we checked out, we had to pay $1.20 for an incoming call (the other hotels usually only charge $1.00 per call). We paid $1.25 cash, and they said they don\u2019t have change.. A few days ago we got our Visa statement, and to our disbelief we were charged TWICE for the stay. We were charged by Priceline which is where we made our reservation with a full payment of $275, and we were charged AGAIN by Hotel Pennsylvania two days after our stay for $250. This is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. If the hotel were to charge us, they should have said something when we checked out. When we checked in, we already gave them our confirmation number so they should already have a record of our payment. We called them immediately but it was after office hours, so we called again the next morning. The accounting clerk we spoke to did NOT apologize for the mistake they made, and she said it takes 7-10 business days to get our refund back. We are from Canada, our Visa card is in CAD currency. For Hotel Pennsylvania to make the mistake of double-charging us, we are probably going to lose $5 due to the currency exchange rates. That is $5 I am NOT WILLING to lose because this is the Hotel\u2019s mistake. The service at the hotel was not good, everyone who worked there acted like they dreaded the work. Next time if all the hotels are fully booked, I would rather stay at a hostel for $25/night. Honestly, if you like the location (next to Madison Square Garden), if you don\u2019t care about the condition of the room, and if you can find a deal for $50 or less at this hotel, it might be worth considering.

However, you're not in New York City to sit in your hotel room. If you're like me and you will be out sightseeing the whole time, then does the style of the hotel room really matter? Once it's clean and safe. And seriously, we could see the Empire State Building clearly from our hotel room. The staff were friendly and very patient. By patient, I'm referring to the safety deposit boxes. These are kept in a secure location behind reception and a member of staff has to retrieve your box for you, but you can access them as many times as you like through the day. We never got any attitude from the staff when we were constantly going to our safety deposit box. There is an Irish Bar on the ground floor, if you're into that.

We was finally given a second room consisting of a double bed telling us another bed would be brought to our room. Over two hours later, several phone calls and trips to reception my 'cot' arrived. Tired from travelling the thin mattress on a metal frame was hardly the highlight of my trip. The fact my feet hung off the end was bad enough then the phone rings not far off 1am to check i had finally got the bed. Do this hotel not communicate?!?! Next day after a disappointing start to our stay we asked to be transferred in to another more appropriate room. At 2.15pm we was allocated a room with 2 double beds, again not what we had booked. We went to the room and left items there including purchased presents and sunglasses. When we returned to the room gone 9pm all items had been removed from the room!!!! We had been checked in to the room but it appeared they had not communicated this to house keeping. We received some items back but not all, after being told they was in lost and found!! (This was after several phone calls where i kept being transferred and hung up on.) Surely it was not lost if we had left them in what we thought was our room where our belongings were safe. We was later informed by an individual on the front desk that \"If you leave items on the bed or floor than housekeeping dont care and could remove it\", Also security told us they often had problems with items going missing....we did not feel safe leaving important items in the room after this.

Yes it is old and yes the rooms are small (as are all NYC Hotel rooms). But in terms of value for money I think this was great. We had upgraded when booking, for only a few pounds, to a Penn 5000 room - this basically puts you on a higher floor. The check in was simple and the staff polite and helpful. We had no issues. We were on the 11th floor & yes the hotel could do with a makeover and modernising, but our room was clean as were the towels and the bathroom. The maid came everyday. She cleaned, left fresh towel and changed the bed linen. The TV worked and again we had no issue with this or the room. I think if you do have problems the staff will be willing to help in anyway they can so long as your are reasonable and polite - afterall they are there to help and the few occasions we asked they were really helpful. There isn't a safe in the room, but the hotel does provide free safety deposit boxes - again simple straightforward and not an issue for us. The location of this hotel is fantastic. It is right opposite Penn Station with easy access to all the NYC Subway has to offer. You can step around the corner and see the Empire State Building anytime you want to and Macy's is just a block away. We didnt find (or look) for the coffee lounge that is available to those who upgrade, but there is so much food & drink on offer close by that there seemed little point. My only \"don't bother\" is for the Lindy's Diner attached to the hotel - it is overpriced and actually just a short walk away is the Moonstruck Diner on 38th & Madison which is far better value and has good service with a vast menu. Little Korea is a must - don't be put off by the lines at the restaurants - they are usually fairly short and the food is again excellent quality and tasty. Another suggestion would be that if you want to avoid the line for the Statue of Liberty is to pre-book before you go. It will stop you waiting for a couple of hours to get through security and on to a ferry. Another favourite of ours is the Brooklyn Diner on 57th and 7th. It is the same as the one off Times Square but is a little less touristy and has excellent food/shakes. Don't forget to check out the East Village - St Marks Place has great restaurants and is very vibrant and colourful at night. We enjoyed Virage. When it comes to gift shop shopping - shop about - those on or close to Times Square charge a few bucks more for most things than those off the beaten track. Especially those at South Street Sea Port at Pier 17.

I can stongly say that this was the worst I have ever been. In my trip to New york I had 12 people with me and all of them travel agents. We were all shoked from the hotel. First they did not allow us to do a group check-in ( or at least allow one of us to queue) ...nooooooooooo we had to wait for more than 1 hour to check-in and the staff was really really rude. Next thing I know is that the corridors were very very dirty and smelly. The rooms were also old and smelly, but at least not that dirty. The location of the hotel was very good, but this is the only good thing about it. I have never felt safe during all 3 days there and it turned that my feelings were right ( I will show more about it in below). A lot of people were in and out of the hotel without no control at all (most of them were not staying at the hotel at all). Tha last day in the evening all the others were in their rooms and I was in the lobby working in my laptop ( as in my room the hotel never took the effort to bring a LAN cable for the internet) and once I have finished I went at the elevator. Inside there was a blond guy with glasses, dressed with jeans, runners and an coloufull adidas shirt and seemed very calm and \"safe\". I have steped in the elevator and I have pressed (15 my floor) and I have noticed that the guy didnt press any button at all....Once the elevator door closed the guy looked at me and said : \"DO YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE SAFE WITH ME IN THIS ELEVATOR ? \" I have started shaking and I was not able to reply, I only shaked my head as a yes sign..in the meanwhile he still didnt press any button. Next he introduced and wanted to shake my hand ( and I accepted as I didnt know what to do), he said that he was from Suedia and he started to laugh for no reason. Next he said that I could not go to 15-th floor and I should have gone to the top. Than he continued to talk no sense......He was not violent and he never tried to phisically approach me and also didnt seem or smell like he was drunk ( I assume he was just a psyco). Finally the door opened and I went out first and he came after me. Luckily for me, he start walking faster than me and he was like 2-3 steps in front of me. I immidiatly run into the elevator again and I saw that he came back after me but lucklily for me the elevator door was closed again and he couldnt make it to come inside. I went downstars and called security and explained even on more details than above what happened. They couldnt care less and the reply I got was that it was just a bad joke from a young turist and than escorted me to the room. It was a happy ending for me ( as I was lucky and brave ).....as nothing serious happened, but it was really really frightening.

The hotel was built in 1919 and it was surely a fine hotel at its height in its youth. It is a beautiful building from the outside and the lobby is spacious. The elevator doors remind us of the 1920s. But that is where the beauty stops. At the check-in counter, we were greeted by an extremely rude Indian clerk. He asked if we were checking out and I told him we were checking in. He replied that check in started at 3pm,and even when I told him we\u2019d requested early check in, he repeated that check in was at 3pm and they had no rooms available before then. He refused to see if he could respect our early check in request. So \u2013 after10 minutes, he went took his break and my partner spoke to another clerk to see if we could get a room. We did and we checked in at about noon. Once off the elevator, you step into the waiting area for the elevators which leads to a dark and gloomy corridor that runs the length of the building from end to end. Along the corridor there are guest rooms, and there are several alcoves that lead to other guest rooms. You\u2019ll have to read the signs above the entranceways to find your room. These corridors have wall-to-wall carpeting which is some shade of brown (I think) along the edge and some kind of floral design in the centre. If it\u2019s dirty, you\u2019ll never notice it because the carpet is dark and so is the corridor. We stayed in Room 1182 which was designated as a Penn 5000 room, whatever that means because I have no idea what benefits it grants. It was a small room, a little bigger than the average interior cruise-ship cabin, with too much furniture: an empty mini refrigerator, a large 3-drawer dresser, a large desk (which was very unstable) with a chair, and a bed. The bed was said to be a double bed, and it was small and thoroughly uncomfortable. On the ceiling above the table and not far from the bed, there was a black spot which I think was mould in a water mark. At certain places on the walls and doors, either the paint was peeling off or there were huge gouges in the plaster. There was no attempt to cover or fix it, though I did notice that near the door too much paint has been applied and it has run down the wall. The bathroom was small but fully tiled on the walls. The floor of the shower stall looked like it had been repaired badly, or painted and the paint was washing away. The shower head leaked continuously in spite of attempts to turn it completely off. On the inside of the door frame near the base of the shower, the wood of the frame had worn away or had been broken, thus exposing the cement wall inside. In spite of all these inconveniences, it is still a good location. It is one block up from Macy\u2019s (Seventh Avenue and 34th Street) if you\u2019re planning a shopping get-away, and it\u2019s in the Fashion District. It is a great place to stay if you\u2019re going to an event at Madison Square Gardens or if you wan tot visit the Empire State Building. It is ideal if you\u2019re taking an early morning train (which was our reason for staying here) or you\u2019re arriving late at night at Pennsylvania Station \u2013 it\u2019s right across Seventh Avenue from the station. It is a great bargain (we paid $US109 for our 1-night stay) for midtown, but you can get better prices if you shop around and if you don\u2019t mind taking the subway or buses. Other than all those reasons, I cannot imagine spending more than 2 nights at this hotel. If my description of our experience at this hotel has made you re-consider staying at New York\u2019s Pennsylvania Hotel, it would probably be worth paying more to stay at a better hotel. [I\u2019ve heard 2 opposing stories about the future of this hotel. One is that they are currently undergoing major renovations to upgrade the rooms and services, but they obviously missed the 2 rooms we stayed in. The other story says that this hotel is slated for demolition to make way for some new construction, but no one has told me what that is. They must done or the other because the hotel is falling apart, and that is a shame because it has history and it really is a nice an unique building.]", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA Hotel out of 1984 - A truly hellish experience.\u201d", "Author": "nakavi", "ReviewID": "UR99190400", "Content": "I am a very avid world traveller who has been to over 40 countries, and I have literally stayed at every type of hotel around the world and I can honestly say I have never had such a hellish hotel experience in my life.

One of those places where you are afraid of catching herpes just sleeping on the bed - When I got back home, I noticed an email from priceline that I had apparently never shown up to the Hotel but that I would be charged because I didn't notify early enough. That was strange considering that I HAD stayed at the hotel. - Then I noticed TWO charges from the hotel!! I had only stayed one night but they had double-charged me - I called the hotel and finally got to a person. That person asked me if I knew a Sandra...something.

We went deeper into the room to find that none of the three beds were made, a dusty old mirror had broken and was being propped up by the foot of one bed, the heater was set to a boiling temperature, dust was floating all around and last but not least the bathroom had a dirty towel, with a black stain no less, and a broken shower.

No matter if you stay at the best or the worst the overall rooms in NYC are small. They are typical big city sleeping arrangements, nothing but minimal space.

Nothing about it would make you think you weren't getting a nice room. Once you get into the elevators and step onto your floor, things change. The large \"bullet proof\" 1950s vault doors are still in place for your room door. They have been drilled and redrilled with new locks over the past 50 years. When you step into your room, everything is cheap. The refrig was on the floor and unplugged. The window did not close and was cracked open about 4 inches. To compensate the staff has the heater on high and the room was about 100 degrees. The bathroom is typical 1950s black and white tile with everything heavy old fashion cast iron/porcelain. Everything was rusted and the facets corroded so they were difficult to turn on. The TV was old and barely worked. We had to purchase our own remote batteries to get the TV to change channels. Almost every day we had to ask for maid service even though there were maids working on our floor. Our business associates stayed 2 nights and finally had to leave due to the mold growing on their ceiling, that was causing one of them to have an allergic reaction. (They moved to the Marriott Marquee) The main draw of the hotel is that it is immediately adjacent to Madison Square Garden. For my purposes, the location was worth the room. I do recommend you inspect your room prior to accepting it. Just get the key, tell them to wait with the luggage and check it out. There is a definite difference in the rooms! We paid way to much to stay there ($259 per night) but rooms could be had for $79 in this hotel using the right booking service. I would recommend upgrading in room size (and these were going for $99) as we had a larger room than most people and it was easier to maneuver. We had friends at the Affinnia and New Yorker. Both very very close to our hotel. Those at the Affinnia said it was much nicer than the Penn. and those at the New Yorker said they had some updated and remodeled rooms which were nice.

The floor tiles were chipped and dirty, the bath itself was chipped and worn and the wall tiles were falling off. The screws holding things in place were rusty and the mirror was cracked.

Hotel Penn was an amazing deal, at an amazing price, and we stayed there over New Years... so to get the kind of deal and pricing we did for that time of year... was amazing. I won't lie... the hotel is old. It was built in the 1920's or 30's or something like that. It shows in some of the decor, and in the doors to the rooms... but on a whole, let's be honest. *Hotel Penn is located across the street from Madison Square Gardens, and Macy's. It's located at 34th and 7th, less than 10 minutes from Times Square (walking)... and right next to Penn Station. You could not ASK for a better location in Manhattan. *Stories are true, there are long lineups to get to the front desk. Some of the people working at the desk look nasty... but let's be honest, with all the bad reviews on here, people come in with a bad attitude to begin with. We waited about 20 minutes in line to check in. We checked in on December 28th, which was one day after the HUGE blizzard that hit New York just before New Years... it was chaotic in the city. We just went up to the woman who checked us in with big smiles, asked her how her day was going, chatted a bit about all the chaos in the city... told her not to worry - her day would be over soon, etc. We were just nice to her... then after she checked us in, she went into the back room and brought us out an envelope FULL of discount coupons to use in the city at major attractions. She didn't have to do that, but she did. Super Nice!!! * The beds weren't overly comfortable, but they weren't bad either. I've heard about rooms in Manhattan where you can't even fit your luggage in the room, and there are shared bathrooms. This room had our own bathroom, and accomidated 3 girls, all with big luggage, and we were MORE than comfortable!!! The rooms may be dated, but they did their job. It's like staying at Holiday Inn from the 70's or 80's to me. And it's not horrible. To be completely honest, I can't WAIT to go back to NYC and stay at the Hotel Penn again. It serves as a great place to get some sleep at night, in a city that never sleeps. I am so pleased with my experience there. I think some people need to lighten up - and look at the value they get... vs. paying a great price and then complaining b/c it's not the 4 Seasons!!!", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNEVER STAYING HERE AGAIN\u201d", "Author": "linda3053", "ReviewID": "UR94994640", "Content": "i ended making a huge mistake staying at this hotel. i randomly choose any cheap hotel i could find without reading reviews which was a HUGE HUGE error. always read reviews before staying at a hotel. sure the price is cheap the location is great but is it really worth what i experienced NO WAY. the lobby is really nice. when i arrived i was like OH okay fancy fancy i like it. i got my key went up stairs to my room and to my disgust as i was walking down the hallway i get a chill down my spine it felt like i had entered some sort of insane asylum. it was dark old looking broken room numbers straight out of a horror film. i get to my room the bath tub is yellow (i wanted to vomit) the towels were yellow and they smelled like corn chips. i noticed a red stain on the toilet paper. the water for the shower just trickled down no pressure at all. i didn't even want to use the bathroom it was too gross. the sheets were awful on the bed not comfortable AT ALL. the remote control for the tv didn't work so i had to get up and manually change the channels after walking so much feeling lazy and tired def not something i wanted to do. the chair at the vanity was disgusting. the seat was white like someone had some fun on it. overall i couldn't wait to leave the hotel go home take a real shower and feel clean once again. i will never ever make reservations at this hotel it needs to be remodeled ASAP.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money, great location.\u201d", "Author": "sabrinasrfc", "ReviewID": "UR94403238", "Content": "Just reading the reviews people have written about this hotel can't believe how bad they are.

Landed in Newark airport and boarded the train to Penn Station which is across the road from the hotel. Could not have been any easier - only $25 one way for both of us, considerably cheaper than a taxi if there is only 2 of you. Points for ease of access. Whilst standing in the queue we noticed a sign that said you could not check in until 3pm (it was about 2pm at this stage) but other people seemed to be getting served and issued keys so we just waited. There was 3 members of staff on and it did take a while before we were served but as it was before the official check in time can't complain too much. There was plenty of lifts for getting to our floor (12 lifts I think) so never had to wait long one one arriving. Once leaving the lift the hallway wasn't as grand as the reception but it was clean enough. On several occasions we saw staff using a carpet cleaning machine. Yes the paintwork needed redone and yes the carpet was showing signs of old age but it didn't matter, it was only a hallway. On entering the room there was an overwhelming smell of bleach/cleaning product. The room was very hot so I went to open the window but being on the 15th floor it did not open. Air conditioning system was a bit tempremental and noisy but did provide a little fresh air. Had a quick look around the room, there was a bit cupboard/wardrobe but very little drawer space...just the small unit the tv was on and the two small drawers in the desk. Not too much of a problem though just meant we kept most of our belongings in the case rather than unpack. The bathroom was ok, pretty old but clean enough, towels were clean so all fine on that front. The towels are rather small though and don't cover much haha. There was a picture on the walls and the frame was all cracked and broken - it would have just been better to remove the pic rather than displaying the broken one. Furniture was a bit bashed but didnt affect its purpose, still worked. Bed was clearly old but clean sheets and comfy enough - sheets weren't changed every day but were clean on arrival and we wouldn't change our bed every day at home so didn't bother us. TV worked fine - plenty of channels to choose from which is handy whilst getting ready in the morning. Hairdryer and iron were provided. We requested more pillows and towels which were both delivered within a half hour. Wouldn't say that the room was cleaned everyday, beds were made and bins were emptied but couldn't see anything more than that done. Only the things that looked untidy were cleaned if that makes sense? Some of the electrical sockets were a bit questionable, few wires sticking out in places but I'm still alive. Lighting in the room was bad. There was a light in the corridor area and then just a lamp to light the main body of the room. Overall, not bad but not good either. For the price we paid we didn't expect much - and we didn't get much. The room was clean but far from luxurious but for the amount of time we were in it, it did us fine. One of the tour guides said that permission had been granted to build a skyscraper on the site which makes it sound like it will be coming down at some point so it probably wont be there if we decide to go back. If it was there I probably would stay again.

Be prepared to pay in full for your stay upon check in. Our room had a working refrigerator, very comfy king bed, clean sheets, clean carpets, clean bathroom with a funky old new York feel. The place is a hundred years old and by FAR the cheapest of it's location, it's only rational that the carpet and hallways were a bit outdated. (but VERY clean.). I received mail that was sent before my stay in the mail room with ease from a very friendly and helpful man. The housekeepers were sweet and friendly. I left a key at the desk for a visiting friend with no problem, not even having to wait in line. I was able to go to my valet'd car and get some items no problem.

I do expect a clean, secure room. Our first room was a disaster - filthy, broken furniture, unkept beds and the window wouldn't close any farther than 12 inches. We requested a different room. Our \"upgrade\" was slightly better - atleast the window was closed. Our beds did not have mattress covers, the sheets did not go the full length of the bed (short about 14 inches), the bathroom ceiling was covered with black mold spots, the heater cover was completey off and propped up against it, the porcelin was peeling from the bath tub with the chips laying in the bottom (probably a full cup of them) and the room was very dated with old broken furniture. We went to the store and bought bleach to clean the surfaces. We didn't shower for two days due to the condition of the bathroom - \"spit baths\" only. The toilets don't flush well.

I've done this trip now 5 times. In the past, the Hotel Pennsylvania has provided a good value, even at Christmas time, and has had decent, if not perfect, rooms with good cleanliness, good value, good service. This trip, my first in 4 years, there was a marked decline in every aspect of the Hotel's service. The checkin lines, normally 8 or 10 people deep, were 20, and slower. The bank of 12(!) elevators consistently required waits of 5 to 10 minutes. Coming down, 5 or 6 cars would stop, completely full before one came with enough room to squeeze on, and then would stop at every floor on the way down only to see the desperation on the faces of all the people waiting there for the who-knows-how-many cars it took to find them space. Modern elevator systems can be used to make this better and it's a major hassle when you forego heading down to the street because you're afraid the elevator trip might not be worth it. Our room was on the 11th floor. Our radiator cover fell off every time you got close to it until we jammed a quarter into it to hold it closed. You don't want to see the inside of the radiator at this hotel, believe me. The window wasn't shut quite tight, so snow was coming into the room. This was obviously not a problem just in our room, as plaster was flaking from the ceiling above and water stains on the carpet said the people in 1018 were probably in the same boat. The room appeared not to have been vacuumed except cursorily in the past few weeks. There were odd stains on everything. The desk chair would have been more at home in a crime scene investigation for all the dents, stains, discolorations and foreign materials it was holding onto. Ask for an extra towel or two to cover this up if you go. There were all of 3 outlets in the room, so rather than add a power strip, the hotel simply plugged in only those things it could. With no overhead light in the room at all, this meant that when you had both lamps plugged in at full blast you had a whopping 80 watts of light in a 10x15 room. Apparently this is part of their redecorating and cleaning strategy, if you can't see the crap it might not be there. But with both lights plugged in, you couldn't use the cordless phone, or an internet connection that both needed to be plugged in to work. You also didn't have anywhere, but the bathroom, to plug in any phone charger. The bathroom was fine, if old. The shower water pressure was appropriate for stripping the varnish off old furniture, so any more than a 64th of a turn on either water valve and you were left cringing at the touch of the shower spray. The shower curtain was pretty new and the towels were good. If only we'd had enough to cover the rest of the room with them. The furniture was about a 1980 vintage, it appeared, and really showing age and wear. Corners were off every piece. Handles were missing on drawers. everything was worn. Beds were screwed to the wall, sort of. There was a mini-fridge to store stuff, which was nice. There was no free wifi available in the rooms. No plug in Internet unless you unplugged the light or TV. We received a complementary \"continental breakfast\" with our stay, which we initially tried the first day (and went back to verify the second). After a disastrous 10 minute wait to go up from the 11th to the 12th floor on the elevator, we wandered around looking for the place. At the lobby they tell you it's in room 1210A. Room 1210 had some surprised asians who did not offer us breakfast. 1210A it turns out is on the other side of the building from 1210. It's also not labeled with any sort of helpful room number. When we entered, it was a suite-sized room, maybe 15 x 20, filled with about 30 people. Three scattered bar tables were covered with trash. There were no coffee cups and the table that held the 20 gallon tin of orange juice which was giving up its last was covered in napkins and other trash. There was a bin unit that once apparently had bagels, bread pastries and the like, now had about 12 broken muffins amid a bunch of other trash. The room was dirty overall, overcrowded, disgusting. The one attendant stood without cleaning and did nothing. We left to go to a restaurant outside. I complained to the front-desk manager the first night about the general cleanliness of the room, the continental breakfast and was offered the following compensation: late checkout and a promise that they'd have more food there tomorrow. There were other glitches to the trip, since we were there during a snowstorm. Our room was not made up at all after our first night due to a shortage in the maid staff. We called for towels and they brought them. Lines were longer for checkout due to the storm, which we would have expected. Until such time as this hotel changes hands and has had a massive refurbishment of the elevator system, the rooms and the service staff, we will not consider it at any price, much less the nearly $300 a night they charge for this great location.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "south wales uk", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "borzoidog", "ReviewID": "UR90734861", "Content": "This is the second time my daughter and I have stayed here and I have to say although I agree the rooms are tired but you dont sleep on the walls and ceiling, sheets were changed and spotless towels changed everyday staff in general friendly superb location would recomend.

I offered to pay them double, they refused, I offered them whatever they wanted and they said \"no\" and asked me to stand aside and wait. I asked for the manager who came out and gave me attitude and said that there was nothing she could do and if I went else where we would be denied because we need a credit card. I said \"but we just traveled here from Canada, where are we going to stay\" and she answered \"that's not my problem\" and then motioned to the clerk to help the next person in line.

She left, and never said a word to me!! At this point we had been waiting an hour and a half. I asked to speak to whom ever was in charge, they made me wait 20min before a man emerged with the same \"I'm not going to help you\" attitude. I just stood there at the front desk waiting. I told them this was hard on my feet but this fell on deaf ears. They would usher me aside and move on to the next person in line. When we emailed them the info, they wanted more, when my husband emailed more, they said they didn't receive it. I asked to speak to the manager and he just all together stopped coming out from the back (he never stayed at the front desk to help solve this small issue). We were never shown any courtesy, manners or respect. We were cast aside, ignored and treated badly. We were just so tired and grateful that one person took pity on us at the front desk and helped me until he was finally pulled from the front and made to stop talking to us. We have no idea what we could have done to be treated so badly.

I reserved (in October) 2 nights through \u201cotel.com\u201d (not \u201chotels.com\u201d) and it was the best offer over the internet. Through internet I paid in advance 250 \u20ac, all taxes included, for the 2 nights, for a double bed room for 2 people. When I arrived everything was paid for. At the reception they asked me for ID and a credit card for security reasons. The hotel is super central, right across the street from Penn Station and Madison square Garden. It is located on 7th Avenue, 2 blocks from 5th Ave, about 5-10 min walk on 7th Avenue to Times Square (you could see it from the main door of the hotel), I think 3 blocks from the Empire State Building and 1 block from Macy's. Breakfast wasn\u2019t included in the price but you could get something to eat at a Lindy\u2019s restaurant that exists in the hotel. Breakfast with pancakes costs around US$14 (don\u2019t forget: +tax, +tip). We ended up having breakfast at a \u201cSparrows\u201d across the street. Here an \u201call you can eat\u201d breakfast (although you have a guy putting what you want on a plastic plate) cost $10 (taxes included). Don\u2019t need to leave tip here since it is self-service. This breakfast buffet was basically greasy foods (not the healthiest) and included sausages, potatoes, bacon, scrambled eggs, pancakes, toast (all pre-made and ready to serve). Not a delicious cozy place but good enough to start the day in NYC without spending a fortune on breakfast. They also served other things, like pre-made salads, fruit salads, coffee, and for dinner: pizzas, lasagnas, etc\u2026 Besides Sparrows, across the street from the hotel, you have a Mc.Donalds and small mini-markets where you can get milk, some cereals, and other basic food products. For cheaper junk food (pizzas, hot dogs, etc) you could also go to Penn Station. Be aware that this area, restaurants, fast-food joints and shops, have a big ethnic variety and many of them may not be the cleanest of places nor have big worries about hygiene. Many of the people that work in these places hardly speak English. The entire area around the hotel, 7th Avenue, from the hotel up to Times Square looks the same. It is very central, very colorful, with lots of people walking on the very busy streets giving you a feeling of safety and therefore I consider it the best area to be, although it is also quite dirty looking. As for the hotel, lobby was very nice and modern, with lots of middle/upper-middle class looking guests (Portuguese standardsJJ) from all over the world (coming and leaving, by the hundreds, with shopping bags). We were lucky and didn\u2019t take more than 10 min in line for check-in. It is a very big hotel. With more than 1.000 rooms. I assume that around check-out time (12 pm) there could be a bigger line, since everybody could be trying to check-out at the same time. There are 4-5 counters at the reception desk. After reading trip advisor reviews we asked, during check-in, for a higher and newer room. We were told that all rooms were the same and that there were no new rooms so they gave us a room on the 7th floor. Didn\u2019t see other rooms so can\u2019t say if I got one of the better or the worst ones. The room wasn't all that nice: old and not spotless clean: The room had a window with view to another section of the hotel. Basically the view was to another part of the hotel\u2019s building (but of course there are rooms facing the busy street. I don\u2019t know how you get them thoughJ). On the side we could barely see the street. The floor in the room was a bit dirty (not spotless), a bit of dust and paint from the wall in back of the TV, in corners, around the electrical settings. The bed sheets looked clean (which was essential for us to stay in the room), one of the bathing towels was stained (don\u2019t know if it had been washed or not so didn\u2019t use it just in case). They had shampoos and soaps. Bathroom looked clean although things looked old. The shower had paint coming off from the floor and sides. If you are fussy better bring some sandals for the shower and slippers for the room. In the room, there is a phone (with the possibility of receiving calls and messages), a small closet and an ironing board. TV was also old but functional, it had the regular American channels for NYC. Not much space for the 2 suitcases we brought but we managed to move things around in order to have them open and on the floor so we could easily take things from them. The doors of the room looked reinforced so it seemed pretty safe inside. The corridors of the hotel could look a bit scary (especially for a woman alone) since they are old looking, wide and you don\u2019t always have people walking around. There seem to be some video cameras in some parts of the corridors, I suppose for safety reasons. The safety is related to it being such a big hotel, with so many people, making it easy for an outsider to get in the hotel without being noticed. There are also other entrances to the hotel besides the main entrance. There is however a man, by the elevators, who is supposed to be asking the room keys as you go bye although he never asked us to show him the keys. The hotel also stores luggage after you check \u2013out for US$4 a piece. Can\u2019t say staff wasn\u2019t polite. They were nice (not too nice) but nice and polite enough. I suppose for NYC standards they were ok. I had a small problem although that was rapidly solved: The night before I checked out I called the reception from the room and asked if it was possible to check-out at 3 pm since my flight was at the end of the day. At first they told me the latest I could check-out, free of extra-charge, would be at 1 pm but then they accepted the 3pm. The next, day, when I came to check-out, at the reception, they told me I was supposed to have left at 1 pm since there was nothing in the \u201ccomputer system\u201d that said I was allowed to check-out at 3 pm, so they charged me half a night (about US$60). I was upset and complained but was in a rush to get to the airport so I paid and left. They gave me an e-mail to complain to, so the first thing I did when I arrived home was to write to this e-mail address (I think it is the manager\u2019s). They rapidly replied saying they would give me back the amount they charged, so I suppose overall I was well treated. Overall I think it was worth it and I would stay back at the same hotel...specially because of the excellent location and relatively low prices for NYC. But I knew what to expect and was prepared: It is an old, big, 2 star hotel. Maybe not advisable if you have a toddler that could put his hands or mouth everywhere like on the dirty floor or electrical wires in back of TV. If you are very fussy with cleanliness you better go somewhere else, but will certainly pay much more and will be hard to get something right in the center. Another inconvenience is that these other cleaner hotels (check Park Savoy near central park) could be on emptier streets which could make it more unsafe to walk, especially at night (in the winter it is dark at 4pm), to the main and popular points of interest, so take this into considerations before you reservation. Another possibility could be to stay at more distant hotels (located out of Manhattan, near the airports (Newark or LaGuardia) or somewhere else, that are served by the subway/train system allowing you to get a better and cleaner hotel for a cheaper price and fast access to Manhattan (beware of train fares that could get expensive depending on your location).", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "oak hill", "Title": "\u201cshabby, shabby, shabby\u201d", "Author": "travel4fun20171", "ReviewID": "UR89774458", "Content": "Overpriced, even during the holiday season.

However, we were not expecting a queue of several dozen people in a long long line to check in (think airport), slowly slowly moving forward because there were only 3 check-in staff working (slowly, slowly). This wasn't helped by a reception head / concierge faffing around behind the scenes but not rolling his sleeves up to help out. Upon arrival at the reception desk there was no apology for the delay (which would have been a nice touch) and the service was laconic, indifferent and slow. Finally we got to the room (late afternoon) to find that it hadn't been cleaned from the last guests... The hotel is actually very attractive, with a large marble lobby, a classical, somewhat art deco style and enough lifts operating to service the crowds. The room was pokey (par for the course in NY) and tatty. The furniture was circa 1972 (not in an ironic or retro way - ugly stained wood bulky commode and table), the sheets were ripped (but clean), the bedspread was sticky (lovely...) and under no circumstances would I recommend bare feet on the dark brown carpet. Naturally the TV remote control didn't work, the mold on the ceiling was unappealing and the bathroom a dingy shade of yellow (possibly a former white in decades past) with fittings that were servicable but unattractive. It was a place to lay your hat (but not a temporary home, by any stretch of the imagination). Upon check-out 2 days later we had to face the queue once more in order to buy a 4$ luggage tag for each piece of left luggage for the stock room downstairs (why they couldn't trust the downstairs personnel with this service is beyond me). I left a jacket in the wardrobe (in my hurry to check-out no doubt) but of the jacket there was no longer a sign based on subsequent phone call discussion with the hotel.

This time the New Yorker was fully booked and the Hotel Pennsylvania was only one 'reasonable priced' hotel near MSG/Macy's that we could find. We are too old for any hostels and don't want to spend a fortune for a room where we stay as little as possible :) We arrived at 6 PM and there were no queues at the check in. The service was pleasant and professional. We had booked a Penn 5000 room with one king bed and we got our room from 12th floor. The room just okay and clean enough to our standards. The bed was big & comfy and the sheets were clean and solid. It seemed that the air con unit was very old and had not been used regularly. As I turned it on some dust was flying out of it. The cleaning lady visited our room daily and changed the towels & sheets and did the daily cleaning/hoovering. First morning we went for the continental breakfast that included to room price but that wasn't so spectacular: coffee, tea, toast, marmalade, croissants, pastry. But you can live wit it or try some decent deli's near the hotel as we did :) But the best thing about this hotel is the location, location, location! Just cross the street from Madison Square Garden, one block from the Macy's and Manhattan Mall, one block from the Broadway, two blocks from Empire State Building.

NO bed bugs, Check-In staff were great, Security was fantastic, and i cant say enough about how great the location is! People really need to lighten up on this 2 star hotel, it definatley exceeded my expectations and if people want 4 and 5 star they need to learn that they will be stuck paying the price.

It's an old place with a great location, near subway and train station, and near Macy's, Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden.

So, why not deliver a free wifi access? Many hotels at the same price do the same. They also charge for luggage storage, I don't know if that's normal in NYC, but I believe they could do it as a courtesy for their guests. I've made a reservation for a 3 bed room, but when I got there, they said that there wasn't any room with 3 beds available. Luckily, when i got to the room, it had 3 beds. Maybe their reservation system wasn't ok or they fixed another room for me. The room was really big, with and old TV and no wardrobes. Its cleanliness wasn't great but that would be too much to demand a clean room with carpets all over the place. The bathroom wasn't clean enough too. Some days there were woman's hair on the floor, although we where 3 men. The shower didn't have a flow control, only temperature control, so taking a shower with less water was impossible. The corridors walls were a little bit dirt, and it looked like the Apache hotel of the movie The Shining.

I was moved 3 times because I just could not stay in the allocated room, the first was on the 8th floor and it really was the most disgusting thing I have seen. I went back to reception and the manager who must have heard it all before so was most unhelpful did give me another room which I thought was something from a horror movie. The paint was chipping off the walls, the bathroom had urine stains on the toilet seat, the curtains were non-existant, and then I did the ultimate. I checked under the sheets and mattress, and yes, you guessed it BED BUGS....By now, it was 12am and I was exhausted, so I slept fully clothes, even with my shoes on on top of the bed, using my coat to buffer the contact with the duvet, and moved out the next morning. This room was on the 2nd floor, which resembled a youth hostel with all the college kids hanging around, although even they were complaining! The next morning, I went back to reception and they moved me to the Penn Club Executive room on 13th floor, which was marginally better, in terms of the room being painted and the furniture not looking like it was found in the garbage. The maid even gave my room an extra clean, and the benefits of this room was the complimentary breakfast, which was a bonus, but served in the smallest room ever, so it was a cramped and rushed experience in the morning. The reason why I do not believe this hotel will spend $$$ to refurb is because it was full the entire week, so why spend $$$ when people are staying. Yes, location is a +, but I suggest stay in Soho at a small boutique hotel and really get a comfortable enjoyable stay. THis hotel is a stain on NYC and it should be ashamed to be standing amongst the great city, and I wonder how much repeat business they get so my advice is do not stay, find somewhere else and hopefully the more bad reviews and reduced business they get, will encourage the management to sort this place out. If you do stay, do not accept the first room allocated, and make sure you check for bed bugs, because they are still there.

But we asked to leave our bags, and were told we had to buy a ticket, and then take our luggage downstairs to leave (tickets are $4/bag). Lobby was nice enough. The guys that staffed the luggage area were friendly and funny and really nice. From there, it went downhill. * We asked about a bathroom, having just traveled in and unable to get into a room. There were bathrooms downstairs near baggage, but they were being painted. Upstairs, a surly guard at the elevators told us 'this is a hotel, not a public restroom', even though we had just checked luggage and he knew we would be checking in. Someone finally sent us up to the third floor to a ballroom, saying it was open for hotel guests because they were painting downstairs. It was locked. We let the desk person know, and she told us we must be wrong! We finally left.

I would have tried a different plug, but the plug cover was broken across the elctrical outlet and I was afriad to touch it with no cover. * The TV in the room did not work. * The front of the shower handle (that adjusted water temperature) was missing. * Tub was yellowed looking on inside. Sink basin was cracked. * Room was warm and stuffy, but couldn't open window for fresh air.

Dangerous if you had children, and too open - so we stayed with closed. * Two small lamps barely cast any light in the room. * Beds were very hard.

Not only couldn't use it, but it was literally broken, and the sharp metal edges were still there, along with the bent metal where it had been broken off at the door.

Out of 6 rooms allocated to our group, three had to be changed. One had a cockroach running about, mine had a brown oozing damp patch that smelled horrible, a third was a double bedded room when we asked for and were told it was a twin bedded room. Even getting a simple plug ( a stopper they call it in the US) proved beyond them. After the third time of asking, a maintenance man arrived and put the stopper on the key entry slot. To my dismay it was a bath stopper and didn't fit the sink. Internet access is not free, and varies from 2 dollars for 30 minutes to 10 dollars for the day. Given that all of the public buildings we visited AND Times Square have free open wifi access, I find this a bit quaint. The damp foul smelling patch I discovered by mistake and to my horror when trying to open the window and stood in the patch. Upon putting a hotel towel on the patch it immediately stained brown. Upon taking this down to reception and waiting the obligatory 20 minute minimum, I was treated discourteously for daring to have put their towel containing their filth on their counter,. The manager was consulted and to be fair to him, he was actually courteous and professional. My room was changed to a 5000 - even here the main room light didn't work. I would say this is the minimum standard one would expect of even the most modest hotel in the UK. The standard rooms come with cracked and falling off plaster and scuff marks along the wall, old, tired decor as standard.

Alcohol is expensive and watch out for the automatic addition of 18% gratuity on your bill when paying anywhere. We'd stay here again - this was our third time in NY - this hotel compares well to the others (more expensive) ones we stayed in. (Watch out for the comedy club tickets - $10 to get in.

I thought that the reasonable rate(for NYC), the centralized location, and the history of the hotel would make it an interesting place to stay. Check in took forever, due to the long queue of visitors also waiting to get into their rooms. It was like waiting in line at JFK airport to check your baggage! Finally we got up to our room (1240) and one of our key cards did not work. Fortunately, the other one DID, and we dragged our bags and our travel-weary bodies into the room. It was really small. The king-sized bed took up most of the space. The view from the window overlooked an alley. Our room was non-smoking, but my ex-smoker hubby's observant shnozz detected a smoky odor. TV was small, but worked. Same for the bathroom and everything in it. The closet contained an ironing board, but we had to call downstairs for an iron. Also, there were only two lackluster pillows on the bed, so I requested two more. These items were delivered to our room within ten minutes by a polite hotel assistant. Wi-fi is not free in the rooms. It's available for a \"nominal fee\" in the downstairs business center. (I didn't ask how much.) The business center is about the size of a small office and always seemed to be occupied. Wi-fi also is available in the always-busy lobby area, but I would recommend finding a Starbucks or going across the street to Border's. Maybe I've been spoiled, but I've come to expect internet for free at a hotel, if I'm paying to sleep there. Pros: Fabulous location, fast elevators, nice little shops within the building, good night's rest, housekeeping did a good job of making the bed and cleaning our bathroom. Cons: There was dust on the carpet under the desk. Saw a couple of empty plastic cups under the bed. And then there's that pesky internet charge. Other thoughts... There's a cafe and the famous Lindy's restaurant in the Hotel Penn, but I recommend getting out there to explore the area. See more, spend less, y'know? Also, there is SO much rich history in the Hotel Penn's past, as you will read in the booklet in every room. I think they could really play it up more... Have pics of the stars who played & stayed there in its heyday, maybe play some vintage video footage throughout the lobby, perhaps even have a little museum room inside the hotel. I think that if you don't read the booklet and learn all those little factoids, you'd just assume that the Hotel Penn is letting itself just fade away.

So I booked that over the phone, and got the first cab back into the city. Gotta love the location- right in midtown, across from Penn Station, One Penn Plaza (one of my fave modern skyscrapers!), and close to the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden. Niiice. No need to worry about finding food or being bored while I waited till the next day to fly out. My room was on the 12th floor, which is their premiere accomadations. They didn't tell me this at check-in, it was something I figured out for myself eventually. Aside from the bright and busy lobby, this hotel exudes an aura of faded glory. It must have been something else when rail travel was in its heyday, but now it really needs a facelift. I found my room was kinda dark, even with the lamps on. And the bathroom fixtures are in serious need of an update- they just looked dingy. The only place you could get wi-fi was in the lobby ($2 for a half hour) , other than that you had to pay for it in the business center, pay $10 per 24 hours if you had a club room, or wait to use one of the computers in the 12th floor lounge. After being spoiled by the free wi-fi at my previous hotel, this was a let-down. Ugh. The next day I had a few hours to kill before I had to head to the airport, so I decided to take a walk up 5th avenue. However, I was not going to haul a suitcase and two carry-ons all that distance. Unlike other places I have been to, this one charges to hold bags, even only for a few hours. Bleh. I got a distinct nickel-and-dime approach from this place, which was absent at my previous hotel. I'm not going to say that the place totally sucks. But I'm not going to rave, either. With a facelift and a few more free amenities thrown in, this place could be pretty cool.

The room was too hot & stuffy, but we couldn't control the air conditioning, or even open the windows because were no screens on them! Also, the bed was worse than sleeping on the floor. It was like sleeping on a cardboard piece with a thin blanket. AWFUL!!! The ONLY thing this hotel has going for it is the location.

We had booked a Club Penn 5000 room on the 12th floor and as I opened the door to our room I actually said, \"here goes!\". The room was not huge, but was big enough. The furniture was a bit old, but in keeping with a very old hotel. The bed was ENORMOUS and really comfortable, we had a great sleep every night. We had a flat screen TV, clock radio andi-pod dock. The room was very clean, sheets were changed daily. Air con worked fine. The bathroom was small and the fittings old, but it was very clean. Fluffy towels again were changed daily. Nice array of freebie toiletries and the shower worked great, lovely and hot. The Club Penn 5000 rooms also give you access to the Club 5000 lounge on the 12th floor. Not really a lounge, this is just a room, but it provided us with a continental breakfast every morning, and free tea and coffee 24 hours a day. There was a TV in there and we also had free internet access in this room too. This is NOT a luxury hotel by any means but I didnt pay luxury money. The location is great.

I have stayed in this hotel on four occasions now over the ten years I've been visiting NY and I'd say it all depends on what room or I should say floor you end up in. Before my first visit I read that the hotel had had some kind or form of renovations going on, so before I travelled I emailed them and requested a 'renovated' floor, it was a simple as that. The room was standard but clean, my requests for extra pillows and blankets where dealt with quite easily and I found my walk in wardrobe housed plenty of space to store all my purchases and clothing without falling all over my belongings as I have in other hotels (The Edison for example). On my second visit, I flew in with my family just before Thanksgiving from the UK, the first room they offered was fine but the second family room was in a word unsuitable, stained carpet, leaky tap, industrial sounding air conditioning and peeling walls, off I went to the reception and told them point blankly there was no way I would be staying in that room and I wished to be moved, following 3 moves we found another perfect room. I found this a repeated pattern on our other visits, although not so many moves still I refused to settle into a room until I was happy with it. I know some might see this as too much effort to undertake but because of the holidays getting a good deal on rooms is always difficult so I'm willing to just put up with the chance of some manoeuvring. Its true that the hotel is no palace but I've paid for deluxe rooms in the past with plasma televisions and mini bars only to find that I only used the room to hit the pillow while spending as much time out in the big apple so what is the point, I'd rather use the money to treat myself to a new bag or even one of the fantastic to dining experiences that New York offers. The location is amazing, PENN station on your doorstep, in and out for a NY Knicks game and of course a cut through Old Navy to find yourself in Macy's or one of the larger Victoria Secret stores in Herald square so if your willing to use your well earned money else where then a luxury end hotel then this is the perfect hotel.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "little rock ar", "Title": "\u201clivable but will not stay here again.\u201d", "Author": "lkeh1", "ReviewID": "UR81093854", "Content": "This hotel is NOTHING fancy.

The tv and stand were ancient there was wires running across the room?! and the bed was very outdated as was the bed sheets that were dusty and seemed unwashed.

I walked around the block several times before i walked in, convinced that this couldn't be the hotel before the sinking sense of dread kicked in and I realised that I wasn't in the wrong place. - There were dodgy, intimidating looking people hanging around in the corridors and there are patrolling armed guards which make it feel more like a hotel in Lagos rather than NYC. - My room (the Penn 5000 upgraded room at $50+taxes extra/night) was dirty, antiquated and unsafe. If this was a premium room then I dread to think what other horrors I could have walked into. There was a metal door, a heating unit that looked as if it was a death trap (NB any reception that has a notice saying 'smoke detectors are available from reception upon request' is highly worrying) and clearly no health or safety checks had been done recently throughout the hotel. The bathroom shower in my room was leaking and couldnt be switched off upon arrival and everything in the room was sticky and dirty including the bed and a rather manky, yellow sitting chair. All of the furniture was antiquated and it was certainly not a place I could work in - even in a room with an ethernet cable that formed one of several frayed and dangerous looking cables. When I explained the situation all 3 people I spoke to who worked in the hotel, expressed similar concerns and understood my reasons for wishing to check out immediately and receive a full refund. Infact 2 members of staff stated that they 'often had people who were unhappy with their rooms', 'the hotel is 90 years old and most of the rooms should be scrapped and built again they are so bad'. The only plus point I could say is that all of the staff members were very friendly and helpful. They dealt with a difficult situation very well (I couldnt hide my upset at finding myself in this situation) and tried their best to be helpful - I only wish the hotel they are working in wasn't such a hell hole.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe grimmest hotel i have ever had the dubious pleasure of staying in\u201d", "Author": "fussy015", "ReviewID": "UR75165309", "Content": "Have you ever read or seen Stephen king's The Shining?

First of all, be wary of the staff manning the booth (that sells opera tickets/day trips etc.) which is located near the entrance. Initially the guy tried to con and 'force' us to buy the opera tickets, which i later realised could be purchased at a cheaper price if you do not mind queueing up for the half priced tickets in NYC. Besides that, on the last day when we were leaving the hotel, as we were running late for our flight from NYC back to GA, we asked him about the available options to get to the airport from the hotel. He psyched us to buy the bus tickets which were priced at about $15/person and told us that the bus was leaving in a matter of minutes. We decided to choose the bus option instead of taking the taxi as he lied to us that it would be double the price per person if we were to take the taxi instead! After paying for the bus tickets, we immediately ran out to the bus stop to wait for the bus. After about 5 minutes of futile waiting, we returned to the booth where he was, only to find that the bus had already left without us. It made us wonder if he already knew that we would not be able to board the bus on time, but still insisted that we bought the tickets, so that he could get a commission from the sale. We wanted a refund but he strongly denied our request. And since we were in a rush for time, we left the hotel quickly to baord a taxi, thereafter realising that it was definitely cheaper to take the taxi to LGA airport instead of taking the bus! Besides the booth, the hotel experience was bad. The room that we stayed in, was located at the far end from the lift, and the a/c was not functioning properly in the room thus it felt as if we were in an oven during the 2 nights we spent there. Also, the room was very squeezy for 4 (girls) of us. The toilet was small and it wasn't very clean either. On the other hand, the other room that my friends stayed in were nearly twice the size of ours (despite paying the same price) so it really depends on your luck if you ever choose to book a room with Hotel Penn.

KING SIZE BED with DECENT Bedding 3. Water Pressure in bathroom had to be GOLDEN! 4. LOCATION MUST BE ACCESSIBLE My husband I literally only used our room to catch up on sleep and night, and of course to get ready for our days adventures. We typically prefer no service when we're traveling for a short stay, as we find it unnecessary. Because of that, I can't speak to the room service that is provided here. When we first arrived, the concierge area/front lobby was quite busy, and crowded. We stood in a long line to check in, however the line went fast, and the people at the front desk were quick and efficient! The bar fridge was empty when we got to our room. It's not like other hotels where you are charged for what bottles you take out of it. Some people may prefer having options in their fridge, but because my husband and I are fitness and health fanatics, we prefer the fridge empty so we can fill it with our own food and beverages. Driving in NYC isn't ideal, so we checked our car in Valet, at a price of $20 per day. It made it easy and convenient for us as we pulled our car up to the front of the hotel, unloaded our luggage, and off we went! It was just as convenient getting our car back when we departed. Parking is very expensive in the city so if you think you'll be able to save by parking in other lots - trust me - you wont! Go the Valet route... it's well worth the money. Internet access was pretty limited in the hotel (speaking of Wifi here). They encourage the use of THEIR internet services, however keep in mind - you're in NYC!! You're pretty much connected anywhere you go so stick to Wifi, and save your cash for fun excursions! The hotel itself is in a perfect location, walking distance to Time Square, and conveniently located right across the street from Madison Square Garden. The Metro/Subway/Train route (whatever you call your transit system!!) is also located across the street as well. We walked a fair bit, and also used a rickshaw for getting around town - not just around Central Park. They seemed to be just as handy and quick to grab as taxi cabs were! If you prefer to travel in the city in the open, stick to walking about, or using a rickshaw! It was quite fun, and allowed us to experience the city a very open way. Loved it!

The good things? There's really two outstanding ones, and they are location and price. The not-so-good things? Well, when we arrived in the marble lobby everything looked fine until we stepped out of the elevator, walked down a narrow hallway and entered our room and then our hearts sank! Our room did not resemble the smart photos shown on the hotel web site which must have been taken years ago when the furnishings were still new. We were met with musty-smelling chocolate brown carpet, poor quality new towels that shed copious amounts of fluff when used for the first time, an original old bathroom tub with its stained and cracked enamel surface, scuffed, chipped and knocked-about paintwork throughout, and grubby windows that were almost impossible to open. At the time of booking we asked for a room for three and were told there would be an additional bed placed in our room. We arrived to find no extra bed. After calling reception it arrived an hour later. It was one of those steel framed fold-up contraptions on wheels with a mattress just a few inches thick! But in fairness, at least the king size bed was clean and comfortable, the air conditioning worked, some toiletries were placed in the bathroom, and there was a large closet with an iron and board. Our corner room was bright and well lit with two windows and view of Macy's store close by. But as the current owner of this hotel now has plans to demolish it and replace it with a 67-story office tower ( Google ' Penn Plaza tower OK'd ' ) I guess there will not be any more refurbishment until the day this hotel finally closes, which could explain the very obvious lack of maintenance. The baggage holding area in the lower lobby is an absolute third-world disgrace. Two out of three stalls in the mens toilets were out of order and the room was stinking, plus, to deposit our luggage for only 2 hours we had to pay $4 per bag. I don't think I would choose to stay at this hotel again as our sad-looking room did reduce the enjoyment of our stay in New York. It was just OK, above poor, but below average. As is usually the case you get what you pay for and this place, by Manhatten standards is inexpensive.

This hotel was one of the original Statler Hotels, the prototype for hotels offering consistent levels of standards and service back in the early 1900's. Most guests will think this hotel has very strange doors as they are made of steel and have a bulge on the front of them. These doors were one of Mr. Statler's original inventions known as Serva-doors. There purpose was to open from the outside to allow the hotel valets to return pressed clothing to the guest without disturbing or entering the guest room. But this hotel shows how much the standards of travelers have changed in the past century. The location of the hotel is hard to beat, immediately opposite Penn Station which is the heart of Amtrak and commuter trains. Best of all, it is easily accessible from all the area's airports via shuttle buses. Getting to this hotel is the most affordable destinations within the City and allows travelers to avoid the high cost of taxis. Considering this hotel has nearly 1,500 rooms, the hotels lacks a sufficient number of desk agents to handle the waves of customers. I was on line to check-in for nearly twenty minutes at 4:00 PM. The desk agent was fairly personable and being kind and warm to a desk agent makes them much more amenable to special requests. I had not stayed in this hotel for over 30-years and when I told the agent this, she said that I would be ugraded since I was a repeat guests and staying just the night. I was impressed with how I was treated at the front desk. When I got to the room all I could think was what kind a room would I have received if I had not been upgraded? There was hardly a trickle of water from cold tap at the sink. I had to plug my computer into the bathroom as the outlet on the desk lamp did not work and there were no other outlerts The kind bed had a mattress that was well past its prime. It was ironic the shower had the same pressure as a car wash yet it took over a minute to try an retrieve a glass of tap water from the sink. I am tall so it was inevitable I would bang my head on the corner of the metal towel shelf protruding from the side wall in the shower. This is one hotel where the more contemporary outward-bent shower curtain rod would help widen the tub area, especially since my one should touched the wall and the other stuck to the shower curtain. The bath lines were soft and I was surprised by the range and quality level of the soaps and shampoos in the bathroom. Perhaps this is what they meant by receiving an upgrade. Perhaps the single greatest disappointment as a business travel was the lack of WI-FI in the guest room. If you need this you have to go to the lobby or que up to use the bank of computers in the \"business center\". Bottom-line, this hotel is well suited for tourist just looking to crash while visiting the Big Apple and has all the charm of the dreadful Port Authority Bus Station located several blocks uptown. There is a complete absence of quality and service associated with this once great hotel and it is unfortunate the owners did not keep this hotel current over the decades.

We don't live far from NYC, but since the last train home was earlier than we wanted to leave, we decided to get a room. The hotel website indicated they were sold out, but I was able to get a room from Easyclicktravel.com -- $170 (including taxes) for a room for 3 people. For this location in NYC, the price was a bargain. I read all the reviews here and was pretty much expecting the hotel to be completely horrible. I'd stayed in some awful NYC hotel in my 20s, but now at 30something, I'm not as forgiving as I used to be. My boyfriend had stayed at this hotel about 4 years ago, during the same conference. I told him about the reviews. He said, \"yeah, it's an adventure.\" I then said the only thing that would freak me out would be bugs. I wasn't filled with confidence when he just kind of grimaced instead of telling me not to worry. We got to the conference around 10am on Friday. The hotel lobby is very nice, marble (?) and big flat screen TVs all over the place. There are also several leather sofas. It was crowded, but not too bad. We went to the 18th floor for the conference. The elevators were warm, but the 18th floor was very well air conditioned and new-looking. The ladies room there was brand new and spotless. Around 2:55, I decided I would go and try to check in, since I'd read about it taking forever to check in. I timed it with this review in mind: it was 18 minutes total -- that's including the time waiting in line, and then actually checking in. Piece of cake. And the woman who checked me in was very nice. I was given room 406. Made my way back to the elevators and headed up. The hallway is a little dark. Opened the door, expecting the worst... and I have to tell you, it really was not bad at all. There were 3 double beds (I'd thought it was going to be 3 twins, so this was a nice surprise). It was big, and CLEAN. Yes, clean. Smelled fine, and I could see vacuum lines on the carpet. TV was a 36\" and worked fine, all the channels came in. The A.C. was on when I walked in, so it was nice and cool. I initially thought 2 of the lamps didn't work, but they were just unplugged. Plugged them in and they were fine. The bathroom was clean, though some of the paint on the ceiling was peeling (see pics). Honestly, that was the only problem with the room. The TV was in an armoire that had drawers underneath, and there was a writing desk in the room. There was also a sizable closet. I mean, we could've moved one of the beds in there if we wanted to. Very large. That's where the luggage racks, iron, ironing board, ice bucket, and hair dryer were. Hangers were also provided. Vending was not far from the room at all, and the ice maker worked fine. Seemed like there were a few stores in the lobby, but I didn't get around to going to any of them except the coffee shop/deli (coffee was very good). The room was nothing fancy - just a plain looking place, but like I said it was clean, no bugs (I checked the beds thoroughly), the beds were comfortable, and the location is unbeatable.

We were unimpressed with the condition of the first room, as it was run down, and really made us a little nervous to sleep in. But we called, explaining we had been repeat guests and would like a better room. They sent the bellhop to pick up our stuff, no questions asked, and took us to a renovated section. The room was much larger, and so was the bed, which made up for the \"hassle\" we experienced. It is an old hotel, full of history, with 1,000+ rooms, but its in a great spot! Easy to access the subway, very close to all the tourist areas, and midtown so all of the city is fairly close! It really made a difference coming back late afternoon to take a nap, change, and then be able to walk to dinner & Broadway for a show, without having to worry about time! Even late at night the lobby was full of people which made it fun to go out and not worry about coming home to an \"empty\" room!

It's within walking distances to the Empire State building, great shopping, and delicious food at Korea Town. If you don't mind walking it's also about a 20 minute walk to Time Square. As my title suggested it was one of the first thing that popped into my mind when I went there. The hotel itself is very old, and even though they tried to renovate the lobby to be a bit more modern, there was no hiding the cracks in the wall and musky carpet. The decor is very dark and there isn't enough lighting in the halls or in the room. The room itself was small but manageable, and even though the bathroom was renovated, the bathtub had cracks and pipes were exposed. We didn't feel comfortable taking our shoes off and checked the bed thoroughly before sleeping on it. The most helpful thing the Hotel provided was probably the map they give up with your key card. The staff was not helpful at all with the exception of the pleasant storage boy in the basement, which by the way looks like another horror movie set. In fact, I think I got more help and smiles from the other patrons of the hotel than from the staff. They were also very slow and there are long check-in lines every day we went by the lobby.

Windows can not be opened and haven't been washed in years, paint is chipped and peeling, rusty shower fixtures, the dark-brown carpet is scary, and there is a strange, musty, lingering smell that permeates everything. It's worth a visit downstairs to see the safety boxes - if I hadn't been travelling alone, I might have seen the humor in it all, but one look at the broken safe doors hanging on their hinges made me turn around, go back upstairs and hide my computer and passport in a drawer and hope for the best.

Obviously everyone is entitled to there own view but mine is based on going there with an open mind and knowing its only 2 star and CHEAP,at the end of the day I had made my choice paid the money so thought I best get on with it.

Yes a lick of paint is needed as some of the paint was peeling but this really does not affect your stay 1 bit. If like me you stay at this hotel its because of financial restrictions so just dont go expecting the Ritz,I went hoping it would be clean and comfortable with freindly staff and all boxes were ticked !

My experience was actually very good! The location is excellent, being situated within minutes of Times Square and the Empire State Building. It's also opposite Penn Station where you can easily get to/from JFK in about 30 minutes, and handy for the subway. Check-in times seemed to be busiest around 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening, but there was no wait for us when we checked in on a Saturday night at 9p.m. There's also a FREE safe deposit box facility located next to reception. There's an internet place where you can get a card and go online quite cheaply. A luggage service costs $4 (ask at reception) for them to keep your bag in a secure place on the day you're leaving - just collect it by 7p.m. or ask the bell captain to get your bag for you after this time. Check-out went smoothly also, at about 10a.m. (can check-out up to 12 noon). Our room was quite small, but for a two star hotel, it's what you'd probably expect. It was clean and we had clean towels everyday, except once when all we had to do was ask at reception and new towels were delivered. The lid on the toilet seat was quite flimsy and broke when we put a bag on it, but it was replaced without charge. The sink drained quite slowly, but it was cleaned and without cracks. The bath had quite a few cracks but was still clean, and the shower was a perfect temperature (if a little too strong!) The bedding was clean and the bed was comfortable. As it's quite an old hotel, the decor felt a bit drab but what can you expect? I wasn't expecting air conditioning or a TV in the room, but we had both in excellent working order. All the lights worked and were fine. An iron and ironing board is provided in the cupboard, but their guide says they will provide these if for some reason they are missing. The information desk was always manned throughout the day, and the staff were generally quite helpful, although a bit quick to try and send you on your way. The gift shops seemed a bit of a rip-off - just try and find a Walgreens to buy water, etc. (There's one at the Empire State Building, about 4 minutes away). I think this hotel is for people who want to stay in a really well-situated location and who are comfortable with having clean yet modest furnishings. We may have been lucky with our room (everything seemed to work fine), but it seemed as though if there was something wrong, you could tell them and they would try to fix it (the other reviews seem to suggest this too).

If you're looking for a luxurious and relaxing break then maybe this isn't for you, but in New York is there really need to stay cooped up in a hotel all day? There is so much to see so why spend lots on a room when your not there! OK, so it is all a bit dated but i would definately visit again. Our bathroom had a bath with shower which was very clean... apart from a few hairs on the corner of the bath... other classmates had rusty plugs but it was clean. Our room had 3 beds which were all fairly comfy! When we had adjusted to the time difference we slept fine. However, with the hotel being in such a good location all we could hear ALL night was taxi horns! So overall, the hotel is FINE! I'd much rather spend money shopping than on the best hotel! There were no cockroches, no rats, no cracks in the ceiling, no mould on the walls, no rust in our bath, and no coffin doors (as other people as referred to them). The hotel lobby is very large and is probably the best part of the hotel. There are comfy leather seats too. There is 3 shops and a cafe too which are all reasonably priced... however, i suggest buying souvenirs from china town or somewhere cheaper... the hotel will charge $20 for a t-shirt but at china town you can get 3 for $10! One of the shop owners was very friendly and informative and really made us feel welcome in New York! To the left of the hotel is Europacafe, this was great for breakfast as they had a huge selection of fresh food which they cook on order including bagels, pancakes, and oatmeal, and the staff in here are very friendly! I would reccommend ice skating at the rockefeller centre, this is great fun and really good to watch the more experiences skaters. This is really cheap too. I would also suggest a coach tour, we had an amazing tour guide which stopped off at different places over new york such as trump tower, the world trade centre site and central park. This gives you a great understanding of what you're actually seeing! For theatre students i would recommend visiting radio city hall; tour guides take you underneath the stage and show you the mechanical side of the moving stage area.

We got allocated our room, and as soon as we got in it went down hill from there. The radiator was covered in black dust, the walls were mouldy. We thought we could cope, until we pulled back the bed covers. They were stained black and yellow, there was no way we could sleep in that. While one of the girls went to complain to the leader of our group, the rest of us found more faults. As soon as you flushed the toilet or turned on the tap in the sink, the bathroom was flooded. Not really ideal. Then we went into the closet, that was probably bigger than the room itself, and found another door which we opened to find it led to someone elses room, and there was no way of locking. This ment these strangers could walk into our room any time they liked. We complained to reception immediatly, and they upgraded us to a bigger room. At first we were satisfied. The walls were cleaner, the door in the closet locked and the bathroom didnt flood. Thats where it stopped to be honest. It wasnt until i looked in the bath that i realised the plug was mouldy and had hair in it. I for one wasnt using that. As i turned on the tap, the water came out black, which ment for the next 5 days, each of us girls brought bottled water to wash with and brush our teeth. We complained to our leader, but they said the hotel manager wouldnt move us as we were being 'too picky'. We hoped thatd be the last of our bad experience, but sadly not. The first night, i got into bed, it sunk to one side. Yes, my bed had only three legs. I spent the worst 4 nights of my life in that bed, which left me in severe agony with my back. As if my nights sleep couldnt be any worse, the radiators in our room wouldnt turn off. This ment that all 4 of us girls in the room, got hardly any sleep, as we were so hot, and we all got ill as the room was so stuffy. As you can tell, this wasnt the great experience i was expecting.

The location was perfect-literally right next ot Penn Station, so we literally walked off the train and right into the hotel. It's close to Macy's, The Empire State Building, Herald Square, and Times Square. And there's subway stations around every corner for the places that aren't so close. And for the price, you can't beat it. The room (and the hotel) was a little dingy and old, but the room itself was clean, and the bathroom was adequate-we were just in the room to sleep and shower. After checking out early in the morning, we were able to check our suitcase for the day for only four dollars, and they didn't even charge me for the bag I had attached to the suitcase. The only thing I didn't like about this hotel was the front desk service. It took over an hour to check in and to check out, and the front desk staff member I dealt with (twice) was really rude-at one point she called a guest a name ( starts with \"b\" and rhymes with itch) and everyone standing in line heard her. Maybe if they had more than three people manning the front desk, there wouldn't be such a long line all the time, and the front desk staff wouldn't be so surly. Overall, the hotel was pretty much what I expected a New York City hotel to be, at that price level (we paid just over $100 for the night.) If you're looking for a hotel room to hang out and relax in, or something upscale and modern, then this isn't the hotel for you.

Room 504 for the older males was poor but just about bearable to save the hassle of complaining. We had though only one large bed for the three males. I asked for an extra bed at 4.30pm and was told to leave it with them. I arrived back in my room at 9.30pm to find no extra bed. At 9.45pm a camp bed arrived which was pushed through the door for self assembly. The air con was noisy and mouldy. The room must have not been decorated for years. It smelled musty and the fittings and soft furnishings were old and worn out. The bath was dirty and so too were the windows. Room 417 for the females and my 5 year old son was not bearable. It reminded me of a soup kitchen hostel. There were holes in the curtains and the beadspread. The bathroom was not cleaned adequately with hairs and traces of blood and brown stuff (goodness knows what it was) on the floors. There were only 2 small double beds for four people. My partner insisted on a move to another room and was allocated Room 489. Room 489 was marginally better but when preparing for bed at 10.00pm the sink started to leak like a tap all over the bathroom floor. She was transferred eventually to Room 1618A.

The best I could get on such short notice was the hotel pennsylvania, which doesn't even deserve a proper capital letter. The service was absolutely horrible; it took atleast four hours to check in, and they were extremely rude. We had to take our own LUGGAGE to a luggage room, which was tremendously covered in mold and rat feces, and rats themselves, and waited about another thirty minutes for someone to open the door. Once we finally got a room (around 8pm, we got there at about 3 pm), we were shocked to see that the horribly busted doors looked like old dark green coffins, and even the rooms were moldy. I woke up to a bitten feeling on my hand, which was under my pillow, and I look under to see tiny black dots of unknown matter. I slept on the covers, on the floor, which I actually believed was cleaner than the bed, where mold was constantly chipping away ceiling paint onto the headrest of the bed. The prime molding was terrible, and the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. Although the lobby may look \"great\", the rooms are completely of terrible quality, and the restaurant in the hotel was terrible. Although it was a few blocks down from Times Square and right across the street from Madison Square Garden, I am sure that a stay any longer than the time I was there for would have driven me insane, full of lice or bedbugs and whatnot. There are no channels on the TV, which was probably from the 50's. Get this--the \"fancy\" occasion room you may see photos of was right next to the luggage room, which was in the moldy underground basement of the nauseating hotel, was apparently remodeled, and the room looked nothing like it did in the picture. Also, you had to pay to use the exercise room, that was full of sweat and nobody in there. The machines barely worked, to top it off. This is the worst place I have ever been to in my life.

Now, there is 1,700 rooms in this place and they couldn't find 2 together? So we go to our room and had a good laugh. The room was HUGE but barely had anything in it.

However, I had a mixed experience and wanted to try and write a balanced review. As most reviews (good and bad) seem to agree, you can't do much better for location. Checking in wasn't the horror I expected, it was pretty standard. I did see a big queue at reception once during our 5 days. I think if your unlucky enough to arrive at the same time as a lot of other people, then you'll have to wait, otherwise, not a problem. BAD STUFF: The room we were given was as poor as some of the reviews have suggested. Spartan, dated decor. Flaking plaster, film of dirt all over the bathroom from the open window. It clearly hadn't been cleaned or occupied in some time. Probably the worst room I've ever been given and believe me, I've stayed in some toilets in my time. GOOD STUFF: I went to reception, explained the situation and that I'd like to be moved. I was given the key card to another another room and asked to inspect to make sure I was satisfied before they moved us. The room I was offered was fine, clean and reasonably well appointed. Nothing fancy, but perfectly acceptable as a base for our purposes. In summary, this hotel clearly does have some poor rooms, but it also has some reasonably decent ones too. If you get one of those, then it's a good place to stay at a reasonable price in the centre of town. If you get a bad one, make sure you get moved.

I stayed int his hotel with a group for a conference back in March. It looked amazing and so did the website and pictures. Well the best thing about the hotel is the LOCATION! right outside madison square gardens, empire state and Macys so you in the heart of the big apple! Great huh? Well dont get your hopes up! The wonderful start. The que to check in took 1 hour. Yes 1 hour. 2 people serving 100's of guests = 1 hour. Not well staffed or managed + rude staff, not very friendly for a hotel in the big apple. I have traveled most of the world and have never came across a hotel like this! I am not the fussy person who says oh, the door handle was faded or the water was to hot!!!!! The interior of the corridors of the hotel was so old fashioned and run-down it looked like an old hospital from the 50's! Just out of a horror movie. That is the start. Our room was NOT for 3 people as i was sharing with 2 girls. They had to sleep together in one bed as they would not transfer us to a triple bedded room. Lucky i was not sharing with 2 boys!!!!! When asking to transfer room they would simply NOT!!! VERY RUDE STAFF!!!!!! Although half the hotel was empty!!!!! The room had STAINS ON THE FLOOR, BED, WALLS, AND BASICALLY ANYWHERE ELSE YOU CAN TOUCH!!!!!! Bed sheets were stained & ripped!!! Lights in the room were broken, central heating broken!! TV BROKEN!!!!!! The beautiful view you ask?? USA STYLE AMERICAN PRISON BARS!!! Not joking! Why this was the case i do not know. NO body would jump out the window because the room was in a middle of no where courtyard (a small flat land in middle of the hotel with no place to go or jump. So i see no need + the amount of litter thrown there was SHOCKING! The room had about 10% daylight, the rest of the time it was very dark and cold. Bathroom, where do i begin, mirror was cracked, mold and dirt ont he tiles and to finish it off the toilet seat was broken + the shower was VERY tempermental shooting hot and cold water in turn????? This is not the standard for American hotels and think it should be shut down. This has standards for a hostel. I am a genuine customer who stayed here and would never stay again. Please please e-mail me for about 30 pictures of the condition of my room. It was dreadful. This was not a way to start a conference in NYC. The most fun i had was out and about and dreadded the walk back to the hotel every night. I was shocked and appauled with the condition and since then sent several letters of complaint to the hotel which i have had no reply. You have been warned. Do not make the same mistake i made!!!!! & for \u00a390 a night i do expect a LOT FOR MONEY!!! \u00a390 a night is not cheap for a 1 star hotel!!!!!! This should not even have a star, it should be classed as a HOSTEL! In Europe for example Prague a 5 star hotel i stayed in cost me only \u00a370 a night and that was 5 star.

We live in QUEENS, NEW YORK and I decided that we spend the nght in Manhatton, and have dinner at an great restaurant. My wife works not far from the hotel, so she got there before me. When I finally reached the hotel room, after parking the car (VALET-PARKING $40.OO FOR 24-HOURS) my wife was sitting on the bed rocking back and forth, and I could smell the very strong odor of bleach. I looked around the room and found: Used toilet paper sticking out from under the bed, a dirty refrIgerater, dirt and dust in very corner and on everthing, bleach marked rug, and the most nasty thing of all, \"THE TOILET HAD FECES YOU COULD SEE AROUND THE LIP OF THE BOWL\". This room could not have been cleaned or inspected by anyone in \"GOD KNOWS' how long. When I went to the phone to call the manager, it had a thick coat of dirt on it and I had to use my hankerchief to pick it up. I asked the manager to come up to see the room (#1094) and the only thing he said was, someone would be up to give us a key to a new room. It was late so we moved into the room, (#1210) which was still small and dingy, also having a bleached stained rug, no view, but I thought we could make it though the night . We got out of there as fast as we could, to get fresh air and dinner. (WHICH WAS EXCELLENT-LUGO'S CAFFE) Upon returning to the room and attempting to get some rest, (the room was not suited for romance) I kept hearing these noises. By the time I figured out what it was, my wife had fallen to sleep, but I couldn't. (ROOM # 1210 WAS IN BACK OF THE ELEVATOR SHAFT) Everytime one of them went up or down I would hear it. I thought we had checked into the \" HOLLYWOOD HOTEL'' which is a ride in DISNEYLAND & DISNEYWORLD called the \"TOWER OF TERROR'. Early in the morning I went down to the front desk, and told the morning manger about the horrible stay, (Carmen was her name) and she took half off of the price of the room, and said that we could stay in the room after the normal check out. (Yeah right) Before she cut the price, the room was $234.00 with tax. We should have gotten all the of our money back (INCLUDING THE PARKING MONEY) Why? Because this was worst than my three trips to VIETNAM and living in the jungle there, and it screwed up our 10TH ANNIVERSARY. Oh by the way, on the internet The lobby picutures are pretty accurate, but the rooms, FORGET ABOUT!! IN 200yrs. the rooms have taken a beating. In one night my wife and I took one. We cannot afford to do this again for awhile. I'll have to make this up to her later. The hotel has a lot of rooms in it, but as CLINT EASTWOOD said in the movie, \"DO YOU FEEL LUCKY.

The hotel is in a great location i cant believe how close we were to Empire state building,that was right behind us, Madison sq Garden and penn station right in front of us, Times sq about 200 yrds to our right ,also Macys one block away , also if you need any information go and see Frank on the desk he will give you loads of info, loads of places to eat nearby, We loved new york and we will definetly stay at this hotel again!!", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "Title": "\u201cJust the job\u201d", "Author": "Traveller605", "ReviewID": "UR49118537", "Content": "Right in the centre of it all.

However it was my girlfriends first visit to NYC, so we weren`t planning on spending alot of time in the room. Firstly, the check-in and out queues are as bad as previously suggested. And to store luggage in the lobby before a late flight home was a painful experience. Unlike every other hotel I`ve stayed in I had to PAY for the privilage($4 / bag), queue up AGAIN at check-in to get a luggage tag, then locate the lugage room via an elevator and a creepy walk down in the bowels of the hotel. Also there are no restrooms in the lobby. The staff were generally typical New York, direct and too the point, which is fine, but at least a please and thankyou would have been nice once in a while. The rooms were actually OK. I`d requested a `renovated` room, only to be told they had no such thing - honest at least! However the room was very clean, the TV worked fine, and the bathroom was acceptable for this price. Also, I found the hotel corridors to be perfectly well lit and not at all creep as previous reviewers have suggested. The only negatives to the rooms were the maid service. Towels got less and less each day, bed not properly made and attempting to walk in the room at 8am despite the `Do not disturb` sign! Overall, the location and price means that its a bit of a bargain really. It has a motel feel to it, and its clear the staff do not care. This maybe due to the fact the place is looking likely to be knocked down shortly for redevelopment.. Personally I would pay another $60 a night and stay at the Doubletree Met or Novotel uptown.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heemskerk, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cBedbugs!

But the thing is...you get what you pay for. I paid like $126 or something a night. I was right across from Madison Square Garden (which was great because I was there to see the legendary Britney Spears in concert..GREAT concert by the way..if you ever get a chance everyone should go). Across from the train station. Blocks from Times Square and pretty much convenient to a lot of the touristy things. And the subway was across the street to go to the other places I need to go.

However after months of panicking and worrying how horrible the hotel would be and how it might ruin our holiday i was really really suprised.

From a personal point of view I would not use this hotel again as for me although its location was brilliant for the touristy stuff I found that the things I loved so much about new york weren't really in that area and personally I would rather save a little longer and go to a better hotel just for the luxury of it. So my advice is that if you've booked the hotel and are just using it as a base, DON'T WORRY! My guess is that some people were just expecting something amazing for a tiny amount which is incredibly naive and arrogant.

After reading the reviews, we were terrified and almost decided to cancel the reservations and get another hotel, even if we had to pay for high fees for that. But then we decided to relax and give it a try, if it was that terrible we would simply walk away and find another place to stay. We arrived around 1pm and there were only 3 guests waiting in the line for check in. I thought we had a great beginning since all reviews told about the huge lines. But when I walked up to the rude attendant, he yelled at me saying he had no rooms available for an early check-in. I tryed to explain that we didn't want an early check-in, we just wanted to do all the check-in procedures and leave our luggage while we waited and had a meal somewhere in the nearby. Impossible to communicate with the old schmuck, we gave up and decided to wait until the check-in time. When we got back to the lobby at around 3 pm, the line was huge! After waiting more than 1 hour, when it was my turn, I told the attendant (this time was a nice one) I wanted a refurbished room. He told me he would see what he had to offer us and I emphasized that it had to be either a refurbished room or a spacious room, since we requested a TPL. He was really nice and told me he had a good room for us and despite not being a renovated room, he was sure we would like it. And he also told us we could come back and talk to him if we were not satisfied with the room. While we were walking down the hall (on 2nd floor) we were really scared: it's the creepiest place I've ever been to, the smell of mold was disgusting and the carpet and walls looked really shabby. But when we got to our room, I can tell you: it wasn't bad at all. It was a huge room, with two double beds, plenty of place, walk-in closet with iron and ironboard, and the bathroom was one of the renovated ones. We were really relieved, the room was perfect for what we needed and also clean (no smell of mold). A/C was working properly, beds were ok, water pressure and temperature fine, everything was just fine. So, I wrote this huge review just to tell you the following: 1. The hotel is creepy, old and service is terrible. BUT, you might be lucky if you ask for a good room in the front desk by the check-in time. Don't forget to be polite, you get what you give; 2. Location is great, can't beat for this price in Manhattan; 3. Don't expect anything you are used to have in \"standard\" hotels, it will certainly be worse in the Penn.

That description fits for only 1% of the hotel rooms, which will cost hundreds more. Misleading, of course. We booked a total of 3 rooms, each having appliances.

The floors where extremely dirty, you can definitely see how terrible the room/cleaning services are just by looking at the floor and the bathroom.

We bought a 12pack Green Tea Lipton icetea because it's expensive to buy it from coffee shops and all. We told him to take everything in the back trunk, and that included our drinks. Guess what? He opened it and said, \"I might just get myself one.\" in front of my kids. They told me soon afterward, and I just told them 'ok that's his tip.' While I was lining up to check-in, my cousin (who was with me on another car) told me he came up to him asking for a tip, he was persistent too. I was mad at him of course. But I didn't see him again unfortunately. We paid him $10 and a drink just for him to bring them in the lobby. Yes, the lobby which we could have done effortlessly and for free... but he didn't tell us that we have to get another bell man inside to bring it upstairs to our rooms. At least the other bell man we got was nicer. Horrible services and staff! I don't believe there was a pool, if there was, I surely wouldn't want to go. The lobby looked pretty nice for what is a '1-star hotel', but after going up, the elevator was much like a time portal bringing you back to the WW1 theme. Ugly ugly ugly. The doors for the rooms had some weird design as if it was purely designed for stopping 30mm bullets.... The framing was made out of wood and was rotting. The paint on the wall was chipping. The window was stuck. The bathtub's paint was also peeling off. The ceiling paint was peeling off, and every so often some will fall on you. Door knob for bathroom was sticky. Soap was opened and used. Toilet was tainted yellow. Mirror was dirty. Bathroom lighting kept blinking. Floors where dirty, dusty, and stained. Last but not least - it stunk. Go figure. ____________________________________________________________________ Anyways, the location was great, facing Madison Square Garden and a few blocks away from Empire State Building.

I went to New York to experience the city, leaving the room around 7 am each day and returning at midnight each night. The hotel was safe, my belongings in tact, and the bed did its job when I got in it each night. I spent a total of 20 hours in the room over 3.5 days. It's shabby, the lobby is insanely busy, but it's in a terrific location, the towels were changed daily, and the beds were clean. The room was huge (again, by NYC standards), the bathroom smallish, but tolerable, and the staff were as pleasant as you would expect given the traffic. All of our staff interactions were pleasant to excellent. The tickets/tourist information desk is a great feature with friendly and helpful staff. Get the map of Manhattan provided by the hotel, it's a great size for purses and good level of detail for exploring Midtown-Times Square, and the rest of Manhattan generally. There's a subway station 10 ft from the door on W 32nd St to accommodate your transit needs. Head downtown or East to find more reasonably-priced food. Things go faster if you pre-pay and take advantage of express checkout. Depending on when you arrive, the lineup is long, but this should be expected at a hotel with 1,700 rooms. Hotel Pennsylvania is what it is, a bed, a good location, and a decent price. I'd stay again if I was planning on staying in Midtown and wanted to be close to Times Square/Theatre District. As an aside, I suspect a lot of the negative comments have to do with expectations of $500/nt room quality for $150/nt.

The bride and groom next to us had recieved the room as a gift and were told the same thing. I think they were opening their wedding cards for money to pay for the room! Apparently our boss had to fax a bunch of papers to approve the billing. We called him, he advised he did fax the paperwork and provided us with the confirmation #s. The front desk clerk disappeared to check with the manager. He refused to the conf #s stating we needed to pay to stay. Mind you, he never came to the desk, just relayed the message. Our boss called him, he still claimed he didn't have the paperwork and asked our boss to go to the office (at 1am) to resend. I paid on my card, we got rooms.

We called the front desk, the manager didn't acknowledge the complaint, just told us to come back down and gave us new keys. He upgraded us to suites. Large but still a little stinky and old. The bathrooms have no counter top, just a standing sink. The toilets were like those in a public restroom. The most appauling of the bathroom was the used soap left in the soap dish complete with hair. Ewww. By that time it was 2am so we said screw it, no showers. Slept and got up and got the hell out.

It started to fall apart as soon as we arrived. I was the 34th person in line to check-in and there were at least that many behind me - the line went all the way to the door! They only had 2 agents at the front desk, so I called the hotel and asked for a manager and told them about the line to see if there was anybody else that could come help out the front desk. Her exact quote to me (in an extremely rude tone) was \"who do you suggest we get to help out\". I explained to her that I worked in the hotel industry and when there was a line at our hotel, other departments jumped in to check people in and out. She then said that \"this is a union hotel and we don't do that\". So, 45 minutes later, we finally get checked-in! Check-in time at this hotel is 3:00pm and we arrived at this hotel at 3:15pm, so there is no excuse for having such a short-staffed front desk.

Paint peeling off the doors and I am not joking, the hallways and doors make it look like a crack-house! The room does look like the pictures on the website as far as the decor, but those pictures must have been taken 20 years ago, because the room was nasty. There was even this huge hole in the wall next to the a/c and various stains on the walls. And in 2009, have you ever heard of a hotel with no wireless internet in the rooms? This hotel is dirty, offers no services, and has bad customer service. We loved the location since we took Amtrak up and had a toddler with us, so we took a walk and looked for another hotel. The AFFINA is a block over and they were sold out, so I didn't see the rooms. We ended up about 4 blocks away at the DOUBLETREE CHELSEA. It's only a 5 min walk and I highly recommend going there - our rate at the Doubletree was only $25 more than the Hotel Penn - well worth it. Brand new rooms, clean, wireless internet in the room, room service, ice machines, and the people here are so nice! All the stuff you expect from a hotel! When I went to check-out (it was about 6:00pm at this time), the line was still there making me think that this may be a normal thing for this hotel. Like I said before, RUN AWAY!

We booked and paid in advance over the internet for a standard room. We had read about long check in queues but we waited only 10 minutes. The pleasant woman who dealt with us on our arrival said \"I'm going to give you an upgrade - now let me find you something nice\". She allocated us a large room (we had just been in Paris in tiny rooms) with a King size bed on the 11th floor facing 7th Ave. It was clean, there was nothing broken, the sheets (green in colour and a bit old) were changed each day and fresh linen was provided daily. The A/C worked and was adjustable and was not noisy. There was a quiet fridge and a standard hotel hair dryer. Unlike many hotels there was no plumbing noise and we didn't hear other guests toilets flushing or them showering. The room looked just like the one in the photos on the website. Because the room faced 7th Ave the noise managed to penetrate the double glazing. This was our only complaint - but we were in NY - a busy, 24hr non stop metropolis - and we enjoyed being in the middle of it. We are pretty self sufficient but when we needed help we received courteous and accurate advice from the staff including a recommendation for a great Italian place to eat and tips on how to navigate Penn Station to avoid the stairs. The coffee shop downstairs sold pretty good coffee (we didn't think much of the coffee in NY). Nearing the end of our booked stay we went and inquired about staying another 9 days (because we were really enjoying NY) on the basis that we wanted to stay in the same room. We were advised to use the internet to do this as the room rate would be better. We went to the Hotel's internet cafe, which I thought was pretty pricey, paid for a standard room then took the booking sheet back to the counter and they arranged for us to stay on in our same room - which had been upgraded from standard when we first arrived. When we checked out we used the luggage room in the basement and the staff there were terrific. They have a funny system where you can't pay for luggage storage with the Bell Captain you have to go to the main desk and line up - which was a bit annoying as we had just come away from the desk, but it only took a few minutes. In the 17 days we did see some longish queues at the desk and I expect people may have waited up to half an hour to check in - but we never waited more than 10 minutes on the 4 occasions we had to line up. We don't have anything bad to say about the hotel other than they seem to have a battle keeping the traffic noise out - but I suspect that would be the same for any hotel on a busy street in NY. I guess you might think that we have low standards given I haven't been complaining like the other reviewers; but be assured that isn't the case. Yes the Penn is a bit tired and it is very very large and you can feel invisible/insignificant and it doesn't feel \"personal' but it is in a great location and it is reasonably priced for NY.

On browsing the hotel website, we decided to go for the Club 5000 option which gave us extra comfort and other complimentary items. We arrived at hotel early afternoon 3rd July expecting to see long queues in reception lobby. To our surprise there were only a few guests waiting to check-in and there was only a wait of about 10 minutes. We were allocated a room on the 11th floor, which upon entering looked decidedly small for 2 adults and not what was described on the website. We initially thought that the room wasn't a Club 5000 but it was confirmed to us the following morning that it was! We also wanted to know about \"complimentary\" items described on website Club 5000 pages that we didn't have in our room. We were told that we would have to pay extra for those items! I thought that \"complimentary\" meant free with hotel compliments.......not likely at this hotel! If you wanted to have the complimentary breakfast, your room key had to be updated but you weren't informed about this when checking-in. Sound-proofing between rooms leaves a lot to be desired, especially at night when you are trying to sleep, and a couple down the corridor are in are in the throes ecstacy....not that we were complaining mind you!! Our allocated room was away from front of hotel, so there wasn't too much noise from the streets and we were able to get good nights' sleep. The Club 5000 lounge was something to be believed! It was just a small room on the 12 th floor - that was in need of decoration - with a few tables and chairs, a TV and a couple of computer terminals. A small breakfast table was set up in a corner for the continental breakfast. Although the bedroom was very small, it was relatively clean with fresh towels daily, bathroom had been slightly updated with new sink and plumbing and the maid service was very efficient. The room size is not what you are led to believe on the website. It looks like a king-size bed had been put into a single room and that left no space for any chairs apart from computer chair. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful despite the fact that the hotel was exceptionally busy. Internet access is available in rooms at $10 per 24 hours. The hotel has a fantastic location for all New York's tourist attractions and gives you a basic level of accommodation. Be careful if you are thinking of booking Club 5000.......it's not what you are led to believe! The website is a bit misleading!

I was pleasantly surprised! The room had been painted and they had definately changed the mattresses. Not only were they more comfortable, there were no lice! Oh, and we had two Queen Size beds this time. The shower was still so powerful it removed layers of skin everytime I used it but I would prefer this than a shower that wasn't powerful enough. The location is the best thing about this hotel, directly opposite Madison Square Garden (I saw the Knicks and the Rangers and can highly recommend both). It is also just round the corner from Macy's, a short walk from the Empire State Building and directly opposite Penn Station for easy transport. There are loads of good places to eat all around the hotel and Times Square is a 10 minute walk (unless you walk slow!). If people have had bad experiences here recently I would suggest they have been unlucky enough to have had a room that is yet to be refurbished because the room we had was much improved on our first experience.

The rooms do look a bit dated, it's an older style hotel, so don't expect a plasma tv, buts its got everything you need. Only complaint is the shower, took 3-4 min for hot water to come, and the water pressure was very very very high. Shower was abit small, but good enough. Can't stress how good it was to be in this part of Manhatten, you can just walk outside the hotel and theres heaps of things to do. Would definatley stay here again. Great value, If you can afford it, get the Affina Hotel, which is next door.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cgreat value and ideal location\u201d", "Author": "upstateny5ny", "ReviewID": "UR30342101", "Content": "We recently stayed at this hotel.

It was my first trip to the city. We had researched hotels online and finally settled on Hotel Pennsylvania. We chose it for the price and location, plus we felt like it would be fun to stay in an older New York hotel. The pictures we viewed online showed a grand lobby and clean rooms. We arrived at the hotel and after waiting almost an hour to check in, we finally were able to go upstairs to our room. The line to check in was insanely long and very slow moving. But we thought that was a reflection on what a great place it must be because surely it wouldn't be that busy if it weren't a nice place. We found out differently once we reached our room. There were so many things wrong with that room I'm not sure where to start. 1. The carpeting was very old and worn. There were multiple stains and it wrapped up over the baseboards around the edges of the room rather than being tacked down. 2. The tv cabinet was broken. It only had one door that was hanging slightly cock-eyed. The other door was missing. None of the drawers would close completely. 3. All of the furniture in the room was very worn and old and had bare spots where the finish had been worn off. 4. The cable for the television came from behind the cabinet and ran across the middle of the floor to a spot under the window right by an exposed water pipe. 5. None of the outlets in the room worked which we found out when we tried to plug in our cellphones to recharge them after a long trip. 6. The window was open and we had a very hard time getting it shut. We were told that we would be facing the Empire State Building. We WERE facing the Empire State Building but we couldn't see it because of the large brick building about 20 feet outside our window that extended up so far we could barely see the sky. 7. The faucet on the sink came off when we tried to use it. 8. The bathtub had a large hole in the side of it on the inside of the tub. Looked like it had been hit with a sledgehammer. 9. The toilet would barely flush. 10. Every corner in the room had the paint peeling off or worn off. 11. There was no deadbolt on the door. 12. When we turned on the air conditioner it sounded like a jet plane was landing in the room. We immediately called the front desk and requested to change rooms. We were told that engineering would have to check our a/c before they could move us. After a 45 min wait is when we discovered all the other things such as the outlets not working so we called and requested a manager. My friend spoke to Cynthia, who informed her that we could come to the front desk and check out and get a refund. We couldn't get our bags together quickly enough to get out of that room. Once downstairs, it took about 20 minutes to get someone to help us get checked out. My friend had paid for the room on her debit card and she requested something in writing showing that the full amount was going to be refunded. She called her bank and the charge had already gone through. She was given a piece of letterhead with an arrival and departure date but no amounts on it. When she asked for something with an amount on it she was told they were unable to do that. After informing the front desk person that we would not leave without such a paper, he finally gave her a copy of a screenshot on his computer showing the amount. Supposedly the amount would be credited to her account within 24 hours. Almost 48 hours later it still hadn't been done, so another call had to be made to a manager named Mark. Mark immediately called her bank and got the funds put back into her account. I know that this is a very lengthy review but I wanted other travelers to know that they shouldn't be fooled by pictures online or some of the other reviews that are out there. As I said before this was my first trip to NYC and I was very disappointed by how it started out. I was not expecting a 5 star hotel with 100s of amenities, especially for the price we were paying. But I did expect a clean, comfortable room that didn't make me fear for my health. Fortunately we were able to find another hotel but we were not lucky enough to find one in Manhattan like we wanted.

We checked in at 5pm on Sun with no line or wait. Our room, 1022, was huge with 2 queen beds, 2 arm chairs, TV amoire, desk/chair, large closet, and an old style bath. You could easily fit 1 or 2 rollaway beds in the room. The room was well worn, darkish, and not the cleanest we have ever been in, but, not horrible either. The bath had peeling paint, but, that was due to there being no ventilation. Since we would only be showering and sleeping in the room we were satisfied. The hallway did remind us of the movie THE SHINING. It was very long and went on forever in all directions. We rarely encountered anyone else. There was a bank of 8 elevators and we never had to wait long. Ice was readily available near the elevators. The only trouble we had with housekeeping was getting 6 bath towels for the 3 of us (1 for body and 1 for hair). The maid said we could only have 3 unless we called down and asked for more. We did and 3 more were always delivered. Strange. We used the 24 hour coffee shop and Dunkin Donuts next door at breakfast to bring back to the room to eat as we were getting ready in the morning. There was plenty of pizza, fast food, and local restaurants nearby. Location can't be beat across the street from Penn Station and on the bus line with major shopping in the area. Check out was a breeze using the Express Option on the TV and then dropping the key cards in the lobby box. No waiting in line at all. I would definitely stay here again if we could get another great deal.

I had a fantastic nights sleep though some of my family didn't because their room had a dripping tap which did disrupt their sleep. My own room had a huge damp patch on the shower ceiling and but after the first night I spoke with the Hotel manager and he got me a new room instantly, no questions asked. More importantly the location is fantastic and that has to be the reason that despite all the negative feedback this hotel receives people still keep booking.

Unfortunately we forgot to check the reviews on TripAdvisor before we went. Big mistake. We got a good rate and booked the hotel because not only was it reasonable, the location was great too. It is right opposite Madison Square Gardens and within walking distance of lots of the main stores. We enjoyed a Knicks game and to be fair, did not spend a lot of time in the hotel. However.....3 of us were in a top-floor room and despite it being very dated, it was ok. The shower wasn't great but as we spent most of our time out we did not really have an issue with this. 2 of our other friends were not so lucky. They requested a smoking room and were put in a room a few floors below us. On the first night, we got a hysterical phonecall. Getting ready to go out, our friends had suddenly seen a rodent. They claimed it was a rat, but could have been a mouse. They did not hang around to find out. They called Reception and demanded to be moved. After convincing Reception that they needed a new room, a member of staff was sent up. Bizarrely, with a plunger. He did nothing to help and as our friends were being moved out of their room, another member of staff was showing a new couple of guests in to move into the room! They then moved to another room. And the following night.....found more rats/mice (they weren't sure which, but definitely rodents) in their room again. It seriously affected their experience of the holiday as they spent most of the time at Hotel Penn scared and worried that they might find more vermin in their rooms. As well as the constant packing and unpacking. The hotel's attitude was even worse. Our friends had to argue persistently to even get a reduction on their rate, despite what they experienced. All of the rooms that we saw in the hotel had big gaps underneath the doors where we understand the vermin would run in....we saw many rooms where people had actually rolled up towels and stuffed them under the door. This hotel was disgusting. I am just glad we did not spend a lot of time there. I would never stay there again. The staff could have been more helpful/sympathetic yet they just acted as if seeing a mouse or rat in your room was an everyday occurance. Despite the good location, I won't be staying there again. Ironically, when we got back we checked the TripAdvisor website and saw lots of other reviews which had suffered the same experience as us. Moral of the story: check reviews before you go!

Firstly the location is brilliant, you are so close to the Empire State Building , Madison Square Gardens, Time Square, Macy's, Dunking Donuts is right next door (what more could a person want??!!!) lol. We all had a brilliant time and the room was extremely spacious with two king sized beds. One word of warning though, the bathroom really is as horrid as many say it is. On the plus side though, the shower was very efficient and plenty of clean towels. The maids always cleaned the rooms efficiently and made our beds nicely. A word of warning to all youngsters intending on staying here, we did not encounter a safety deposit box in our room, so be warned to look after your hard earned cash. The shopping in New York/Manhattan is absolutely wonderful however the department store staff are extremely pushy and try to force you to buy all sorts of stuff you may not want at all. If you have a very limited budget just tell them, otherwise you could waste a whole heap of cash on un-necessary goods you can't really afford. If you shop in Macy's or Bloomingdales and are British, you can tell them this info and show your passport, then they give you an 11% discount (possibly the tax). It really isn't that much cheaper to buy cosmetics or health and beauty items in the department stores in New York compared to the UK, however I discovered when I reached JFK that my Chanel perfumes and aftershaves were cheaper there, so take a tip and get them at JFK, if you are a lover of Chanel ...no Chanel make-up available at JFK though. One great tip to get around cheaply is, buy a Metro card and use the subway as its so much cheaper, quicker and easier than cabs. A word of warning to youngsters though if you do travel the subway..make sure you get off at the correct stop and don't over-shoot it, as we felt very conspicuous as a group of four, waiting for the next one to take us back to our stop. We were obviously tourists who were a little scared by the intimidating looks we were getting, luckily no harm came to us. Please be re-assured that the positive things about the hotel really do outweigh the negative, so go and enjoy the trip.

Its a big hotel so there is obviously goin to be a small bit of a waiting process like in any hotel. The receptionist was grand if not a bit odd. We were on floor 12 which by reading other reviews is away from the worst parts of the hotels. We had heard that the higher up the better the rooms so had gone on the hotels website prior to go and requested that we be in a newly renovated room. I dont know if this made any difference in the final outcome but worked out alright for us so would recommend doing it. The rooms itself was fine, basic and clean. I have seen some of the pic posted but our rooms was fine and the staff cleaned and charged the beds every morning so we had no complaints at all. The location of this hotel is 2nd to none, directly across the road from madison sq garden and max 15mins walk from times sq. As for as manhatton is concerned you wont find better.

I had to go into DEEP prayer before I agreed to keep them down there. When we returned to check in, the hotel was packed! I took this as a good sign; thinking that the hotel was popular, and that a lot of people knew this was the place to stay. I WAS WRONG. The elevator was nice and clean with a flat screen tv. The minute you step off of the elevator you feel like you are in a different hotel. I felt like I went from a Hampton to Bates Motel. The air was not working in the hallways. It was dark, musty smelling, and HOT. There are holes in the walls, missing wall paper, FILTHY carpet. So I got to my room, and I opened the door, and just stood there. I told my friends to walk out cause I was not staying there. We went back to the front desk, and as I waited, I heard the couple behind me complaining about the same thing. When I got to the receiptionist, I demanded the room that was on the internet. He gave me some random excuse for why I could not get that room, but he did give me another room. Although this room was better than the first, it was not what I wanted. We took a shower in our flip flops. The next morning, I called my father and he asked me what the view was. So I got up (barefooted) and went to the window, and stepped in a puddle of water (water went above my foot). The air-conditionar (a window unit) had leaked all night, and all the water had accumulated in a dirty water puddle. So I got my friends up, and went downstairs AGAIN and requested another room.

I actually thought they were demolishing a building at the end of the block until I got up during the night and took a walk to see what the racket was.

The hotel is very old and in dire need of a re-fit. The bathroom and the bedroom were both dirty (even after the cleaners had been in!), we couldn't open the window as it was so old, the air-con unit was letting out hot air only, there's no ceiling lights either so this makes the bedrooms very dark & dingy.

After 30 minutes waiting to check in with the receptionist who thought we were from Iran or Iraq instead of Ireland although we're both blonde ! She thought it was great that our husbands let us go away on our own ! After check in, we went up in the lift to our room and Oh My God ! It was absolutely disgusting. First of all, I got two electric shocks from the light switch in the bathroom !!!! The room was filthy dirty. The walls were crumbling, the carpet was filthy and the first thing we did was check the beds for animals, I called reception and told the receptionist about the electric shocks and that we wanted to be moved immediately. She sent up a lovely lady who goes around the hotel writing out incident reports (enough said). She took down the details of the electric shock and said she would have a porter come up to move us to a new room. After another 30 minutes, a knock came to the door. I opened the door and a male porter arrived in and his words, which I quote \" So whats the problem, ladies, bedbugs, cockroaches or mice\" !!!!!!!!! My sister went into shock, I think. I asked him if bedbugs etc were common in the hotel and he said they don't have a problem with mice, rats as they have exterminators in every month. However, the bedbugs can be a problem !! He brought us to a new room which to be honest wasn't much better, a little cleaner maybe. This room was tiny but we had paid for the hotel and they were not willing to give refunds. The porter checked the beds for bedbugs without us asking him to do it. Apparently, when you book into this hotel, you are obliged not to complain.

The toilets in the receptoin area shouldnot have been left opened to anybody they were a health hazzard, the smell was unbelievable we did report it but nothing ever got done. I appreciate this hotel gets busy but it's no excuse to treat clients like cattle or infact it could have been a remake of the immigration centre on Ellis Island the way people were handled. The only good thing about it was the location was ideal for midtown but not for a ggod accomodation experience. This Hotel need serious attention but I doubt it would ever be affordable to refurbish however it does'nt cost musc for good customer service.

No there are not safety deposit boxes in the bedrooms but they are in another area just off the lobby. This room to us was perfect for the use of a safety deposit box, it was private & safe. No complaints about it. I wouldn't recommend eating in the hotel at all.

The reception area is not what you will be used to cosmetically but you will only ever be passing though! During the check-in, I politely asked the man behind the desk if he could put us in one of the more \"recently refurbished rooms.\" He went away to check whether we could be \"upgraded\" and came back saying that he was putting us in a nice room with a view of the Empire State Building. At this point, I was still expecting the worst... The elevators are amazing - very old fashioned and I found this charming. Again the decor in the corridors isn't great and the carpet is a weird green colour but it's quite amusing to think that in its day this would have been considered pure luxury! Our room was clean and tidy and had enough space for our belongings. It had a wide-screen TV and a very nice shower/toilet. Remember to bring your own shower gel/shampoo/toothpaste as this was not provided. Our room was cleaned everyday along with clean towels. And right enough, we had a wonderful view of the Empire State Building - we could see it from about halfway up, all the way to the top! I screamed when I saw the view! We never used the heating/air con and it did look very old and dusty. The hotel is 5 min walk to Macy's and a 10 min walk to the Empire State Building (this means you can get up early to avoid the queues!)

The hotel has a rather grand entrance which probably gives a false feel to the rest of what you could expect. Check-in, though busy, was friendly and efficient. It's when you're getting to the rooms that the dated feel of the hotel hits you. The cleaning staff do their best to keep up given the size of the place. It's obvious that the owners aren't prepared to spend anything on updating it. We understand that there are proposals for demolition but the zoning laws might prohibit this and don't expect any radical overhaul. The room was sparse, generally clean but don't touch the curtains with a barge pole!, bed fairly comfortable and the air conditioning worked (thankfully given the heat). As we only had a 2 day stay the hotel was just about adequate for our needs i.e. a comfy enough bed and a bathroom.

The bedroom doors are 'interesting' and you would you think someone painted them blindfolded. Even the superior rooms are in need of renovation as the decor is old and tired.The lights in the rooms are no better than candle power and we had to remove the lamp shades so we could see.The bathrooms have not changed since the day the hotel was built .On the postive side the hotel is in a great location as everything is nearby.The beds ( to my suprise) were comfortable.No sign of the bedbugs... I did check before accepting the room!!!! Clean sheets/towels arrived every day and the room was serviced to a reasonable standard.The coffee in the small deli downstairs was excellent.According to one of the managers the hotel was purchased for the value of the land and therefore as little money will be spent on it as possible.This is certainly very obvious and is such a shame.I wouldn't stay here again even it was free but New York was so great!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cNot Worth the Risk\u201d", "Author": "tgolin", "ReviewID": "UR16879224", "Content": "Me, my mother and my grandmother stayed here for 3 nights.

Clearly a hotel of this size (1700 rooms) simply has good, OK and horrible rooms and I believe that some people have had a wonderful experience there.

She said, and I quote \"The hotel's not important as it's not as if you're going to be spending much time there\", those words came back to haunt me during the whole miserable time I spent at the Penn. We arrived after a long tiring trip from UK and had to wait in a long line for over 30 minutes to check-in. When we finally got to our room it was filthy and the room literally stank of cigarette smoke. I was shocked at the state of the bathroom which was filthy too. We'd booked and asked at check-in for a non-smoking room and this clearly wasn't non-smoking. We went downstairs to reception and queued up again for another 20 mins to get another room. This was as bad as the first plus the bath taps were running constantly (not a drip but actually running) and the toilet seat was snapped in half and unusable. But it did have a fridge (more on this later) To be honest with the tiredness and stress I sat on the stained bed cover and cried tears of frustration and disbelief. I finally gee'd myself up and went downstairs again for yet another wait this time of about 15 minutes and requested yet another room. I spotted some other people actually noisly demanding a refund on their booking and leaving the hotel to stay elsewhere. I was planning to do that myself if the 3rd room was no good. The 3rd room was acceptable (just about) and at my GF's suggestion as we still had the keys to the 2nd room, we manhandled the fridge to the 3rd room. The Asian lady tourist in the lift looked surprised as we shuffled into the lift with the fridge and she said \"I take towels, but never a fridge!\". We stayed 3 nights and our room window faced a brickwall and overlooked an area where the garbage dumpsters were kept. The room was warmish (March in NY is cool in the evenings) and ok but very small, the fridge was useful as the hotel doesn't do food. The fixtures and fittings were tired and worn out or broken. The carpets were threadbare and filthy. The location is good but to be honest it's not worth it, stay elsewhere. This hotel really spoilt our holiday in New York, we dreaded returning to it at the end of the day. Next time I'd spend a lot more and get somewhere nice. After NY we got a hire car and drove East to the Pocono's and stayed at a bog standard HoJo, in comparison it was the height of luxury and utter bliss, so much so we stayed an extra night. Needless to say the \"expert\" travel agent hadn't booked that hotel for us...

We were pleased with our stay, especially for the price we paid - much lower than all the other hotels in a similar location. Firstly the location. You really can't fault the location of this hotel. It is above a subway station which takes you to Times Square and Central Park, one block from a subway station with direct transfer to the JFK AirTrain, opposite Pennsylvania Station, opposite Madison Square Garden, opposite a taxi rank, 2 blocks from the Empire State Building, one block from the New York - New Jersey PATH train, one block from Macy's, one block from the main post office, has a mall behind it and it literally has everything NY has to offer on the doorstep. Check in was a little slow. We waited five minutes to be told there weren't any rooms available with our specification (2 beds etc) for another hour or so. This wasn't a problem as we were early anyway so we took our luggage to the baggage room in the basement. The basement could do with some serious refurbishment but the entire hotel is currently being refurbished and I doubt a largely unused basement is top of their list of priorities. A piece of advice though - make sure you have some 1 dollar bills with you at all times. When we collected our bags we didn't have any small bills as we had just arrived in the country and the staff in the luggage room were quite rude to us for not leaving a tip. All we had were $20 and $50 bills though which we weren't leaving. This was an isolated incident though - most staff were friendly and helpful. We then proceeded to check in, with a 10 minute or so queue to get to the front desk. We had one of the rooms that hadn't been refurbished yet. The paint on the ceiling was chipped in a few places and the window was stiff to open but these were the only real problems - no horror stories that people have mentioned in other reviews. The hotel wasn't busy so we probably could have asked to be moved to a refurbished room but we were tired and I really couldnt be bothered. The room was clean enough, big enough and generally good enough for our needs - we were in NY so how long were we honestly going to spend in the room? There is a snack bar in the hotel which serves drinks, ice cream, coffee, breakfasts to go, danishes etc and we used it quite a lot. The food was nice considering they probably buy it in bulk. There is a restaurant behind the hotel with direct access from the hotel lobby but this was closed for refurbishment. It looked really nice though so I wish we had been there when it was open. For anybody, like my friend, who can't go 24 hours without checking facebook or e-mailing your family next to the snack bar there is a business suite with probably 8 computers, a printer and fax machine. It wasn't that expensive to connect to the internet so I checked my e-mail and directions to things a couple of times when there. It was occasionally full but I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a computer to be available. One thing I did really like though in addition to the location - along with your swipe cards for your room they give you a little popup map with all the sights, subway connections etc in. It doubles as a place to store your key and we used it quite a lot. I'd probably recommend not using it to store your key as if you use it a lot you'll end up losing the key but it's a nice little map. Overall I would say this is a good hotel for the price you pay. It is literally half the price of other hotels in the same area or with the same location compared to transportation so it was never going to be a luxurious, world-class hotel I will remember forever. However I didn't mind staying there. It would most likely have been better in one of the refurbished rooms so if you don't like the room you're in then just ask to be moved - I've seen reports on here of people doing that, and the hotel has 1700 rooms so they're never without spare rooms. Overall I'd say there are definitely better hotels in NY. However we were on a strict budget and had quite picky requirements (we needed 2 separate beds and private facilities) so for what we paid, in the location it was, the hotel probably couldnt have been better. I'd recommend it to others on a budget but if you want a world-class hotel and don't mind paying extra then there are LOTS of hotels in New York so have a look around. As I've said in reviews of other hotels I think it just depends on your standards and how fussy a traveller you are. This is an acceptable hotel in this price range so I don't see what the fuss is about. Yes I am a seasoned traveller and have stayed in some really bad places, and camped at places with no facilities in Africa but this is nowhere near being the worst place I have encountered. I'm usually on a strict budget when I travel (well... more like keep the price as low as possible while keeping the hotel within acceptable limits) and will consider this hotel again.

It must be remembered that with this hotel you get what you pay for. It is one of the cheapest hotels in New York, which is an expensive city. Similarly, hotel rooms in the city are generally small by international standards, no matter what class of hotel you stay in. If you are on a budget- as we were- you can't beat the Pennsylvania for location. Having said that, the hotel itself is of a very poor standard. I believe the Pennsylvania was built in the 1920s, and I would be very suprised if it has been re-decorated since. The main (perhaps only) thing this place has going for it is its location. It is in the heart of Manhattan, right beside Madison Square Garden and Penn Station (which is connected to three subway lines- excellent for sight-seeing), five minutes from Macys, and ten from Times Square. So for the tourist going to the Big Apple for the first time, the Pennsylvania's central location is a huge plus. As for the hotel itself, the standard is pretty low. I would go so far as to say it is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Firstly, when we arrived we spent 45 minutes in the line to check in. When we got to the top of the line, the lady who was supposed to check us in had just realised she made a mistake with the previous customer. She left us standing for approximately 30 minutes while she attempted to rectify her mistake. When she finally got back to us she insisted we pay for the entire stay up front. Finally, an hour and a half after we arrived at the hotel, we were given our key and went to our room. The room itself was small, but as it was New York- and clearly a budget hotel- I expected that. The walls were in bad need of re-painting, and the toilet facilities were also very basic. When we returned later that day I recieved a phone call from reception. It was the lady who checked us in. According to her, she had mis-counted the money we gave her at check in, and we had left her fifty dollars short. This only added to my feeling of frustration with the check in process. Throughout my stay I found the hotel staff quite disinterested in their work. Also, with so many people in the line to check in (no matter what time of the day or night) the lobby of the hotel was more reminiscent of a train station that a place of residence. So in summary, if you book the Pennsylvania you will know it is one of the cheapest places around. Therefore it is unreasonable to expect a top-drawer facility, and this hotel certainly does not fall into that category. In conclusion, given the (relatively) cheap rates and fantastic location, it is probably worth putting up with the Pennsylvania's faults.

I expected the worst, people were saying it was like a prison and very unpleasant and dirty. I could not believe how wrong I was before gonig here. I'm an 18 year old and went with 3 other friends between 18-22, we all expect 100% hygiene and are very picky at where we stay. On arrival New York is out of this world its a dream place to be. The hotel reception was as luxorious asit appeared in the pictures, although it was filled with a school trip load of people which I dreaded as I thought it would be very noisy. After checking in I asked if it were possible to be upgraded and the staff member who could have smiled a little more did so at no more cost. My friends and I had a luxorious king size room each which was up to my stanards of cleanliness. Each room was cleaned every morning with fresh sheets and clean lining towels. Overall, my stay was very pleasant and this hotel is extremely excellent for location - 3 blocks from the Empire State Builiding, 1000 yards from Times Square, 1 block from Macy's department store and also literally across the road from Madison Square Gardens. This hotel had a great location and had very helpful staff in arranging trips, broadway shows etc. The only bad thing about this hotel was the fact that the staff didn't look happy at all but were relatively helpful. The corridors were slightly out-dated and the showers turned from ice cold - scolding hot - we never got a decent temperature and had to keep jumping in and out of the shower. Also the hotel views from our window on the 13th floor were limited to looking into another building across the road.

The Room Our room was on the 10th floor and it was a twin room with two double beds. The room was quite big although abit dark as only lamps no ceiling lights. We had a large TV, radio clock, mini fridge, iron and board. The shower was extremely powerful and always hot. The room was cleaned everyday and we had fresh clean towels and sheets. The Hotel The hotel corridors are abit crazy and do remind you are the film the shining..so if you have never watched the shining do not watch it before statying at this hotel!!!! The door to the room again is abit crazy and does look like a big metal prison door but does a door really make a differance to your stay?!! The lobby was quite big and always very busy. You are able to get a safe, which is free of charge and there is a little coffee shop and some gift shops and internet access. The Location The location was amazing! We were right next to Macys and a 5 min stroll to the Empire State building..10mins to Times Sqaure and right across from Penn staion so you can get to most places easily. The Negatives I will admit that there are some negatives. The staff were all extremely rude apart from the guys who looked after you luggage on departure! So dont go and expect many please or thank yous! The hotel has a diner called Lindys - DO NOT under any circumstances eat here. It was revolting. We had a breakfast for $24 which is very expensive for New York and we couldnt eat it, it was horrible. There are so many other eating places which are cheap and edible so please do not go to Lindys! It should be on Gordan Ramsay Kitchen Nightmares! Summary Overall are 5 night stay was fine. We didnt come away hating the place. If you want a cheap room, which is basic but clean then I would recommend the hotel. Just remember its a 2 star hotel, so dont come here if you want luxury.

The staff tried twice to get the computer to make a key that worked, but to no avail. It finally got so late that I told them to forget it; I wasn't going out and I would just stay in my room until check out. The next problem was that the 7 AM wake up call I requested did not materialize. Since I woke up on time anyway it didn't matter, but obviously it could have been a problem. Finally, there was no shower head, just a piece of pipe sticking out of the wall. It looked like there used to be a shower head at some point. It made it hard to get a shower. This was no huge problem, but together with the lack of a functional key and the lack of a wake up call, it added up to a less than optimal experience. I saw no other business travelers in the hotel. I imagine the hotel is in European guidebooks as an inexpensive place to stay in NYC, which it was. I saw plenty of young Europeans. I saw no other Americans as guests. Of course, this is not a problem at all; as a matter of fact it was fun to be around the guests from other countries. It just was not what I was looking for as a business traveler.

The 3rd night I called security again, and they called a chaperone to deal with the problems they were causing as well as the person that had screamed in the hallway at the top of their lungs and caused multiple doors to open. If someone from the hotel reads this please note; I think that the hotel should have required an adult in the rooms. The view from our room was of the other side of the hotel which was a u shaped alley with no view. The heat worked but the a/c did not, which meant that we could not use it to muffle some of the noise from the people next door. The window was supposed to open, but would not. There were people in a room several doors down that were next to some people that were with us, and they smoked so much (in a non smoking room, mind you) that it could be smelled in our travel companions own room.

We were greeted by some 'less than friendly' staff and took the packed lift up to the 3rd floor. Our suitcases were being unloaded on to patches of vomit which coated the carpet and that the cleaners had obviously failed to notice. The porters must have been blind and had no sense of smell not to notice where they were putting our suitcases!

I was quite happy with the hotel at first, although it was a bit dated, and a bit like walking into 1964 - old, damaged furniture, brown carpets and a bathroom requiring a refurb - but I thought I could look past that, especially as it was a really good location. However, the more I saw of the hotel, the more I could see how dirty it was. The carpet in the room had chewing gum or such like ground into it. The grouting in the bathroom required fixing, the enamel on the bath was in great need of replacing. The corridors needed hoovering and the area by the vending machines was grotty. We stayed on the 2nd floor, and I didn't see any other floor, apart from the lobby (of course) and the lower lobby room, where you are charged $4 to store your cases for an hour or so. The lobby itself was not brilliant either. You could just tell that it was an old hotel that had not been updated for years. I try to make a point of not reading reviews before I go somewhere as I probably wouldn't stay anywhere, but I did with this hotel!! There were pictures on this site of cockroaches, which, I must say, put me off, but hey, it was all booked!!! Third day into the stay my partner went to run a bath and ran back into the room as there was a roach in the bath.

Yet, walking in, the prison-cell idea came to life. The room was far smaller than I imagined, with two VERY small beds that oddly took up the bulk of the room. We were also greeted with missing necessities, like a clock (we were forced to use phones/laptops/the TV for time), a refrigerator (which our neighbor had) and most importantly, clean sheets. To top off such a warming entrance, one of us decided to brush our teeth and was 'delighted' to see that the water had a yellow-tint for a few moments after being turned on. Although many describe the bathrooms as extremely old and disgusting, it isn't as bad as you may think.

I only wish I'd read TripAdvisor before committing myself rather than afterwards when it was too late. It is true - you cannot fault the location. We got the airtrain from Newark to Penn Station and it is less than a 30 second walk from door to door. It's opposite Madison Sqaure Gardens, adjacent to Macy's, about 3 blocks from the Empire States Building, 10-12 minutes walk from Times Square and about 15 minutes from the Port Authority bus terminal. But that's all you can say about it. You could sleep on the pavement outside and get all of that. In this day and age you should not have to choose between location and standards.

I was unfortunate enough to stay herel on my recent trip to NYC. Personally I don't expect much, I just like to stay in a basically clean, maintained hotel - and this one does not fit that bill. One thing to note, is that I think *some* of the rooms may have been renovated - which is why there are a couple of positive reviews, but the chances of getting a nice room are very slim. The sole positive aspect of this hotel is the location right across from Madison Square Gardens and walking distance to Times Square, Macys & many shops, theatres, attractions and transportation. The hotel website pictures are very deceiving, since the lobby is the best looking part of the whole hotel and it goes way downhill from there. The few staff we encountered were generally pleasant and helpful, its too bad they have to work in such a rundown place. Take a look at the candid traveller photos - they accurately represent what you're getting! To begin with, the whole hotel is absolutely filthy - I couldn't find a single clean area during my visit. Everything from bangs, dents, stains and marks on walls to peeling paint, rusty fixtures, and broken furniture. Our room came complete with an electrical socket that hung out of the wall, a window that wouldn't close, a bathroom knob that actually came off in our hands and an unmentionable bathroom. The bed came supplied with a broken mattress, worn sheets and stained coverlet. I never took my shoes off in the room, didn't sleep well & did not feel clean there. Its tough to relax and have a nice hot shower after a long day of sightseeing with paint peeling around you and above your head. This may be *budget* New York, but personally I'd have paid a LOT more to not have to stay there. I would think that if you've planned a long awaited vacation and are spending a few days in the city you'll feel much more relaxed and comfortable in another hotel. Although I've never stayed there, my best friend who stayed with me recommended the \"Edison\", similar in price range but much nicer and cleaner overall. To that end, I saw several hotels around the area - so it would pay to do your homework here. Parents, don't bring little ones - I wouldn't want any of my kids on the filthy floor or touching any of the bare wires or broken things I saw all over this hotel. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, much less a friend or family member. You'll only be happy here if you don't care at all about the cleanliness of the room you're staying in, just need a place to crash for a night or two and spend as little time as possible in the dank and dingy cells they call rooms. My two cents, cabs are cheap in NYC - if you can't find a hotel to fit your budget within walking distance of Times Square consider staying out of the district in a nicer hotel and use the money towards cab fare or transportation costs.

With a rail/subway hub right across the street and the Empire State Building right down the street, it could not get any more convenient. Granted, the building itself was a bit shady. Public bathrooms downstairs were pathetic to the point that after walking in, I walked right out, preferring to use the bathroom in my room instead. Also, the main waiting area on each floor looked like something out of a ghost story. (I later found out that the condition of the waiting area was a good indication of the condition of the rooms on the floor, which would explain why some people got it very good and some not.) Staff were both mean and friendly, depending on who you talked to. As far as the room goes, though, it was really, really OK.

Prior to our departure we read some of the worrisome reviews given about this hotel but found they were not true and we were pleasantly surprised. After being on the train for 3 days we arrived Monday evening tired and wanting a good night's sleep. Check in was a breeze. The Lobby was clean, gorgeously decorated for the holidays, and beautiful. The Clerks were all cheerful and helpful and the Bell Captain, Fritz (yes that's his name), was wonderful. He took our luggage up to the room (we stayed on the 13th floor), turned on all the lights, turned on the television, made sure all the channels were working, opened the closet to show us our iron and board, and opened up the blinds to show us our view (which was spectacular of the Hudson River). Our room was clean and spacious, we had two double beds. The bed linens appeared new, they were clean, and the beds were comfortable, the paint and carpet appeared new and there were no stains, tears or mold, and there were no odd or bad smells, just the smell of a clean room. The furnishings including the mini fridge were in great condition and all perfectly functional. The bathroom was basic (but we did not pay to stay at the Ritz Carlton and who lives in the bathroom while on vacation anyhow) but it was very clean, functional, and had plenty of hot water at all times. Our maid (did not get her name) came daily to clean and did a wonderful job, she kept the bathroom well stocked with toiletries, supplied us with abundundant towels, changed the bedding, and if she happened to come while we were still in the room would leave saying she would come back later and always did. As for location...THIS HOTEL IS PERFECT. So many of the sights and major shopping stores are within walking distance and if you happen to want someplace a bit further then the subway, cab or bus system are all out the front door. As for the hotel restaurants...Lindy's was a bit pricey but the food was good. Joe's O's was more reasonably priced, the food was excellent, and the portions were big. City Perks is a little coffee shop that has very good and quick pick-me-ups. There was even a souvenier shop in the hotel that had reasonably priced items compared to other shops in the area. Right next door to the Hotel is a Dunkin Donuts, Roy Rogers, and Nathan's Hot Dogs. Kmart (for any last minute items you might need) is across the street.

The ac and heater are disgusting and covered in rust. There is mould everywhere. Oh I could go on! The only good thing is the location and the fact that it is relatively cheap by New York standards. However I have been to NYC several times and would advise staying in a nice hotel a bit further outside town if you can\u2019t afford the waldorf but want to stay somewhere nice as the subways are a great way to whiz around and the taxis aren\u2019t to expensive. A couple of touristy things to do include the obvious - A show on Broadway. Book a ticket directly at the theatre as they are much cheaper. - The station island ferry is free. - Macys and tiffany\u2019s is a must. - Bubba Gumps on Times Square is great for dinner one night and have the shrimp platter - $20 and it\u2019s amazing. Plus they do strawberry daiquiris - China town is a must for your fakes (you have to get off the subway at the canal street stop) - Soho has great shops Avoid NY in the summer as it gets really hot and is not the best idea if you are shopping or dragging a boyfriend/husband around with you. April/May is a great time to go as is the winter months running up to xmas as it gets very festive.

We arrived early and couldn't check in, but they will graciously store your bags in their dungeon-like basement for $4 each. Check in wasn't a problem. The hotel corridors and rooms are stale and smelly. We kept our window cracked the entire time just to get fresh air (highs were in the mid-30's while we were visiting), but it was worth the cold air. Our room was clean, but very, very dated and overall depressing. The comforter was burned in several spots. Again, we knew not to expect much because of the price. The shower had hair in the drain and although the water pressure was good, hot water was NON EXISTANT. My complaints were ignored. Don't waste your money on upgrading to include the \"breakfast\" - it consisted of OJ, coffee/tea, and a very small selection of stale pastries and bagels. There was no fruit, bottle water, yogurt - nothing else. Also, the night manager (Mirium), called to wake me up one night so she could get a copy of my credit card so that she could close her books. OK, give me a break! No messages were left, no notes, nothing during the day - we had given the hotel our credit card and both of our cell numbers at check in. But instead of trying to contact us politely, the rude manager calls to wake me up to get my credit card. She was unbelievably unapologetic and rude. We weren't in the hotel much, thank goodness, but on our next trip to NYC we will DEFINITELY spend a little more money to get a better hotel.

It was Sunday and the lobby was very busy, we had to wait in line for about 15 minutes, we checked out no problem and then went to leave our luggage in the luggage room.

Also in the morning you can get free breakfast (which was bagels and fruit). Bearing in mind there are no coffee/tea making facilities in the room, we found this very useful! The rooms are pretty basic. Mine was rather dark and cramped and had a tiny bathroom, although the bed was comfortable enough. I saw 4 separate rooms visiting other family members, and they were all different. I'd recommend ear plugs, not just because you're in central Manhattan, but the walls are a bit thin! The hotel has some trivia too - apparently it was the largest hotel in New York back in t of history - apparently the Glenn Miller wrote \"Pennsylvania 6500\" in reference to the hotel's phone number. I think if you plan to spend a lot of time out sightseeing then the Hotel Pennsylvania is probably a good choice of hotel. Would I stay there again? Not sure.

This place is TERRIBLE!!!! DON'T STAY THERE!!!\u201d", "Author": "cl9904", "ReviewID": "UR11074638", "Content": "In a nutshell, the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York is an absolute mess. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels in Europe and North America for both leisure and business travel, and my 4-night stay at the Hotel Penn was easily the worst experience I've ever had. The entire experience was negative from the moment we arrived at the hotel. The reception staff (even those in the \"exclusive\" 5000 Club) were terribly rude, and gave us the impression that we were intruding on their time merely by being there and wanting to check in. We arrived a couple of hours before their check-in time (3 PM), and elected to check our bags in with the bell desk. We were more than bit surprised to find out that there would be a per-bag fee ($4) for this storage service (note: this was NOT a tip, but a FEE). You must take your own bags to the basement level to be stored, and then retrieve them on your own. I only bring this up because such service is complimentary in EVERY other hotel in which I've stayed in NYC. The main level lobby is still relatively nice, and gives a hint of the Hotel Penn's past glory. However, any signs of this hotel being a luxury property disappear as soon as you step inside the elevators. The elevators creak, moan, jerk unexpectedly, and seem to be on the verge of sticking between floors. When you arrive on your room floor, prepare yourself. The interior corridors remind you of the inside of a mental institution or a maximum security prison. They are dark, musty, stale, and utterly lifeless. The room doors are HUGE, concave-shaped (both on the inside and outside) steel monstrosities that are hideous to look at, and seem to not want to stay locked. The rooms are small, dark, and don't seem to have been refurbished in at least twenty years. The paint is cracking badly throughout (there were several people in our party, and this was present in every room). The televisions mysteriously turn off and on by themselves. The bathrooms are microscopic (approximately 6 wide by 3 feet deep, COUNTING the space for the shower). If you are 5'10 or taller, your knees will likely be pressed against the door when you're seated on the toilet. The water in the shower alternates between being scalding hot and icy cold -- there's really no good way to predict which one, and neither maintenace or management is going to care about it or do anything to remedy it if you call to complain). For some reason, all of the rooms were swelteringly hot. None of our rooms' air conditioners would work. Above all else, the Hotel Penn is ridiculously overpriced. The rooms at this hotel should be priced at no more than $75 per night -- despite the fact that it's in a great location. There really are no redeeming qualities for this hotel, except for the fact that it COULD be a great property if it's ever purchased by a large chain that would be willing to poor the millions of dollars that are needed into upgrading its interior -- and to train and hire a proper staff. I did not encounter a single person in the entire hotel who deserves to keep their job. I mentioned to one of the younger employees that I'd thought about cancelling and moving to another hotel after reading some of the reviews on here, but decided to give it a shot after reading several others which were positive. After experiencing this dump myself, I am certain that every single bad thing that you read about this hotel in these reviews is true, and every positive review is some sort of mistake. Avoid this hotel at ALL COSTS!!!

The hotel looked very promising on entry and the reception staff were very helpful and we checked in to our room on the 14th floor. We were first given a room that was occupied but it was quickly changed. From the lobby you enter the lifts to your accommodation and enter a completely different world. The corridors were dark and dirty and the doors to the rooms were reinforced which gave you a bad impression. The d\u00e9cor of the room we stayed in was shabby, the carpet was heavily stained cracks in the wall and chipped paint, the shower tiles were hanging off and the shower was cold. We also had chewing gum stuck to the wall in full view from a previous guest and the phone was ripped from the wall. We had a good view of 7th Avenue and the beds were clean. My grandmother stayed on the 16th floor and our friends on the same floor. Their rooms were very similar. We went to see the duty manager about the standard of the rooms just to bring it to their attention. The Manageress we spoke to immediately asked us if we wanted to vacate our rooms in a rude way and said that they are typical of the standard we paid for. We didn\u2019t want to leave we just wanted to raise certain points. The excuse was that it was house keepings problem (but surely if you are a duty manager you would rectify there problems?!). She said if we wanted to leave we would have to find other accommodation within 30 minutes or we would be given a penalty, we were shocked by her attitude. We could tell she was not bothered by our complaint and knew she could sell our rooms again as it was a busy. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. Be warned, if you have a good room it is because you are paying an extra $50 per person per night plus tax and you are on the upper floors of the building.

We had one bedside table but no lamps just one across the room (no electricity sockets near bed) Having been to NY before we did try to book Grand Union which is were we would normally stay but this time fully booked so opted for this - Never ever again - if this was the only hotel left in NY then I just wouldn't go - Its a disgusting filthy rotton dump of a building that either needs knocking down or renovating and as for the staff apart from the one lady who originally dealt with us on reception and the 2 at the information desk I dont think anyone else there had any idea of manners and seemed more interested in keeping the customer waiting than helping in any way.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cgood value for location bad service from staff\u201d", "Author": "Divil", "ReviewID": "UR10251878", "Content": "just back from a great time in NYC only 2 warnings to give...

Small but adequate bathroom no blood on towels or any of that bollocks, maybe those ppl were just unlucky. Bed sheets clean, no bugs or stray hairs. Walls had a few scuff marks from shoes but again...dont be so bloody picky! Anyway i just want to clear up everyones doubts on this Hotel. Hotel Penn is absolutely fine, clean but basic, fresh but not colourful. Its very central, Penn station right opposite and will get you anywhere in Manhatten, loads of places to eat including the food court in the mall about 5 minutes away which has lovely shops. You couldnt choose a better Location or Hotel when staying in New York. Seriously, you just need a place to wash and put your head down, that clean and Hotel Penn can give you that!

The Bathroom: all I can say is it could have been better ... there was no plug in the bath, and the top of our toilet seat was filthy. We give the cleaners the benifit of the doubt but the next day it still hadn't been touch but they did manage to fold over the loo roll very nicely!! what the heck! We ended up cleaning ourselves. Everytime we took a shower the bath leaked leaving the floor soaking... luckly we had extra towels to put down.

New furniture, bathroom spotless and it was very nice. The view was just of a building across the way which didnt bother me in the slightest. There was a huge tv. Our room was a superior king room and it honestly was just lovely. The cleaning staff were so polite and friendly always saying hello in the morning.

Before I left Ireland I e-mailed the hotel and voiced my concerns about the hotel that i read in the Trip Advisor I also asked for an early check in as I would be arriving around 12 noon,and I also requested a room on the 12th or 15 floor as they seemed to have got good reviews.I got a reply from a Barry Rauch who is in front of house operations,he told me that everything would be alright as they have 1700 rooms and the amount of complaints were minuscule and if their was a room ready at 12 noon that I could have it, Well I got to the hotel and the length of the queue was 20 feet long there was no indication if the queue was for checking in or out as their was only 1 person dealing with everybody,their was a good few areas with reception written over them with people behind the counter and nobody was going over to them,so I went over to 1 of them ,the man behind the counter informed me that the long queue was the one for check in i started to walk away when he called me back and told me that he would check me in it took about 3 minutes ( Happy days) I asked for twin beds and got them and he then gave me the key,when i got to the 5th floor room it was dreary but ok !the bathroom was clean and the towels were okish! the bed was clean I pulled back the covers and inspected the sheets and they were clean the only trouble with the room was the dreariness if they got proper lighting in the room it would be a big help,the fridge was working but you had to unplug either the tv or the table lamp in order to plug it in.Small things can ruin a stay and I feel that this is the problem with this hotel also avoid the restaurant in the bar at the back of the hotel breakfast was 29$ for 2 eggs and 2 rashers it was daylight robbery we got better breakfasts for half the price elsewhere, also Lindy's at the front of the hotel, we went in one night at 9.30 and the waitress gave us the menu and took a drinks order she came back with the drinks and then told us that the kitchen was closed but we could get snacks at the bar !! we upped and left and told her to keep the drinks! now down to business ,would I stay in this hotel again ?? yes I would it has a great location and the hotel itself is not that bad the 2 restaurants are probably franchised out so the hotel probably have no control over them I might have been lucky but I can honestly say that the hotel was jam packed and if it is as bad as some of the reviewers are saying then that would not be the case! getting a good room in an hotel is a bit like getting a good seat with leg room on an aeroplane if you don't ask for it you wont get it I had no cause to complain when I was their so I cannot comment on the response from the staff but any body I was in contact with were courteous I was travelling with my wife", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Donvale", "Title": "\u201cOverrated and overpriced\u201d", "Author": "jaygeeb", "ReviewID": "UR8708960", "Content": "Location was good but it is not value for the money.

Our hopes were high, did we find a hotel in New York worth staying in that wasn't over $800 per night? Our hopes were high as we stood in the lengthy line to reach the check in desk, which they were only running one clerk, but maybe it was break time we hoped. Finally we arrived at the counter, and going through the check in process, as we were about to procure our key, we are told the rooms are not ready. We're ok with this, we are about five minutes early for check in time (3:00). So we all run down to McDonalds and pick up a burger, about forty minutes later we return to again check in. Another wait, only to find out they still are not ready. Is this clerk the same person cleaning the rooms? Or maybe that is where all the other clerks are. We then sit in the lobby, with about a hundred other weary travelers, for another hour. Finally, after another line, we are ready to check in, and we check in! The cleaning Lady (no 's noted), has done her job. Boarding the elevator we are somewhat pleased with the overall quality of the facilities thus far, only if we knew what awaited us when those doors parted. Arriving on the 7th floor, the elevator doors began to open. Immediately the smell of mold and musk rushed into the elevator. The air must be really dense up here. Stepping out into the hallway we are immediately threw back in time to yesterday, no yesteryear, no yester-decade!!!! Walking down the hallway it takes me a few minutes to realize we are indeed still in the 21st century, and this is in fact not an episode of The Twilight Zone! We enter our room, and spend ten minutes making sure we are in the right hotel, that we didn't mistakingly go down a few extra blocks to the YMCA. We sit down on the Beds (after thourghly inspecting the sheets), to turn on the television. After numerous clicks of the remote, and then trying the buttons on the television itself, my friend kicks the Television Stand out of frustration, and much to our surprise it finally comes on!! Granted we can't change the channel, but the Chinese guy giving a lecture about Science is better than a black screen. We call the front desk to report or small inconvenience, \"Someone will be right up\" they say. Over an hour later we call back, \"Someone should have already came up there, I'll call them again\". Thirty minutes later someone finally shows up with a very poor looking television and a handful, no a sack full of remote controls. He tries all of the Remote Controls and finally finds one that works! Yay, we can change the Channel!!! Shower time, the first of our travelers goes to the shower, fifteen minutes later he comes out and the water is still running. \"You can't turn the water off\" we get from him. So we all have to leave the water running in order to take showers. We are finally able to get it to shut off after we all finish. Though it was not an easy endeavor. Time to get ready for the Play. We open up the Ironing Board. Ok, we try to open it. The ironing board is broken and will not stand up. We call the front desk, but remembering our earlier experience we head down to our other Friends room and borrow theirs. Pulling the Iron out to being ironing, guess what!! The iron doesn't work!

This is our second trip to the city from the West Coast. During our last stay we stayed at a hotel on the Upper West Side. Since we were looking for a more central location, we chose the Hotel Penn. You can't beat the location of this hotel. It is smack dab in the center of everywhere you want to go. The subway is literally 2-3 minutes away. The hotel itself, I would rate as a 2 1/2 star hotel. We arrived early and had to leave our bags in the luggage room in the basement until our room was ready. They charge $8.00 per bag which I was not particularly happy about. When we returned later that day to check in, the room I had requested was not available, so we settled for a room w/ 2 twin beds overlooking the avenue. We were up on the 13th floor. The room was quiet (considering we were overlooking the avenue) and was adequate sizewise. There was a refrigerator, desk and chest of drawers. THe beds were o.k. The bathroom was a decent size, however there was some mold in the shower/tub area. This is an old hotel and could use a total remodel. However, the rate we paid was very reasonable considering what one usually has to pay for hotel rooms in New York. I would stay here again, only because of it's location, not for the rooms or ammenities.And besides, who goes to New York to stay in the room?

I would bet that the rooms have not been updated since the 1950's which wouldn't matter much to me, although the curtains, carpet, and bedding all appeared to be 20+ years old. The paint on the walls was coming off, and the air conditioner barely worked. The blanket on the bed actually had holes in it, and the bedspread was soiled. I was actually concerned when I went to plug my cell phone into the outlet, as they looked so old that the though of electrocution came into my mind. My kids were walking around in the room in their bare feet, and after about an hour their feet were black. We had friends staying here as well, so we visited their room and it was basically the same setup and highly disappointing experience. If you are a college student or a young traveler, these things may not bother you, but if you have children or are a couple please take my advice and look elsewhere.

We were given a room on the 16th floor, the elevators were spotlessly clean and very fast, there were 12 in total serving our floor ! on reaching our floor we stepped out into a large communal area with corridors leading off in all directions, yes these were a little dated and the decor needs a little touch up, but its ok. We stood outside our door and took a deep breath in, inserted the digital key and stepped in. The room was large with two double beds inside, there was air conditioning via a unit under the window that really worked well. The decor was reasonable, nothing scary at all. The only down side was the bath, it did look a little tired, but this was made up for by the shower which pumped out steaming hot water relentlessly every morning and evening on demand. The staff at the hotel were always polite, helpful if not a little eager to get you sorted and move on to the next guest (after all it is new york).

Personally, I loved it - the hotel was built in 1919, in the days of big band, and at the peak of railroad travel. It's glamourous inside - long, sweeping corridors, a bank of old elevators, chandeliers and a beautiful marble lobby. It's a bit daggy - the paint was peeling off the walls, the windows were dirty and the electric wiring looked dodgy. It's sanitary, though - and the maids are really nice. You get what you pay for. And I'm not going to spend an extra $100 per night for a hotel room that's slightly more up to date. After all, you're in New York - what the hell are you doing if you're in your hotel room for more than 8 hours at a time? It's big - 1700 rooms on 18 floors - so some of them are bound to be less than perfect. I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic weekend away or a honeymoon - splurge on the Radisson Martinique for that. But if you're a traveller on a budget, a vacationing family, away for a girly weekend, or a business traveller, the plain, functional rooms (with a touch of faded glory) are just perfect. One thing I found frustrating was that there was no information in the room - I had no idea how much the phone cost, if there was breakfast available, if there was a laundry, or what time check out was. The only other bad point that I could find was that there was no in-room internet access. There's wireless access in the lobby, for $2 per half-hour, so the lobby's full of people on their laptops. Many people have commented on the location, and I agree completely. The sole reason I chose the hotel was because of it's proximity to Penn Station. I don't travel light, and after lugging my suitcases out of the station, it was just brilliant to see the hotel lobby right across the crosswalk - who wants to bother with a cab after a long train ride?

We booked the Pennsylvania through HotelsRus but subsequently read the reviews and horror stories. When we arrived there, we found the receptionist extremely friendly given the queues and I immediately asked for a refurbished room - (floors 10 to 15?). The receptionist advised us that: - our booking through the hotel reservation (HotelsRus) was for a standard (unrefurbished) room - refurbished rooms carried a $50/night surcharge and we could could not be automatically upgraded - the hotel was full - limiting our negotiation capacity - we should see the room on offer before paying for an upgrade. Taking this as sensible advice, we found the room was basic, a little tired, but generally clean, with working air-conditioning and shower, no mould, etc - a more than reasonable room for a tourist rate hotel in NYC. We enjoyed the experience. Another point worth noting - nothing to do with the hotel but a JFK airport scam. I was so focussed on the hotel issue, that arriving at JFK (tired), we allowed ourselves to be intercepted by someone claiming to be part of a subsidiary of the SuperShuttle service (JFK to NYC hotels). Called himself Dave Ross (??) and gathered about 9 couples allocating then to ShuttleVans which would be arriving shortly. He took three couples to his own vehicle - a Toyota Sienna -about 5 minutes walk away in the Airport parking area. He talked about insurance certificates, loaded the vehicle & chatted away. Talked a lot about new transfer fees across the bridges, tunnels, etc and eventually stung us for another $40 at the hotel in addition to the usual transfer fee. (The other 6 couples probably had a long wait for non-existent vans but saved themselves some money and a hair-raising drive.) With hindsight, he was clearly targeting long haul travellers (tired, more gullible & less likely to confront); his van did not carry the SuperShuttle logo; he probably was not insured.

Do not stay at this hotel if you desire anything in terms of quality and service. We have been going to NYC for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show for quite a while now. The Penn is the host hotel for this show, and it is convenient, but up until this year, we had never stayed there because of all the stories that we had heard. Unfortunatly, due to extenuating circumstances, we had to make our reservation at the Penn because we made our reservations late and the hotel that we usually booked was full. We figured \"it can't be that bad,\" and \"it's so close to the Garden.\" I don't care if they move the center court line at MSG to the lobby of the Penn, we will not be staying there again. When we arrived, we had to wait FOREVER for a bellman to assist us with our bags, and they won't LET you do it yourself -- some kind of union thing. We got into our room, and while it wasn't as bad as we had anticipated, we were less than impressed. It was a TINY room. An exciting part was the VERY LARGE bathtub, just perfect for a bubble bath - except when you collect the water in the tub, it was a brownish green color - EWW. So all was going well, until we came back from siteseeing our second day there - unable to get back into our room. Our key would not work. We went to the front desk for duplicate keys - they didn't work either. We waited in the hallway outside our room - mind you our show dogs were still locked inside our room - for 3 hours for someone to fix our door. After we finally were able to enter our door, they told us that we would have to move rooms, because they didn't know for sure what was wrong with our door and couldn't know for sure if it would happen again. So we loaded all of our stuff up on carts - we were there FOR the dog show and we had A LOT of stuff. And headed to the next room. This one was even tinier, AND the wall outside the bathroom was literally disintegrating, meanwhile dropping debris on the carpet. When we told the bellman that this room was unacceptable, he said that his shift was over and he had to go home, so he left our things in the hallway, and we waited for a different room, and a new bellman. Two more substantard rooms were offered before we arrived at one that would work. It was actually a room upgrade for us, and was quite spacious. Not good enough to make me ever want to go back. The next few days went by without anything remarkable to note. Then came time to check out. A storm was coming, and we wanted to leave in time to make it home (ohio) before we would be affected. So we got up early the day of check out and called down to the front desk to call for our car. They said when the car arrived we should call for a bellman. We waited almost an hour for the car, and when we called for the bellman, he said there would be an hour wait. It eneded up that we did get stuck in the snow and hour away from home, and if they hadn't made us wait twice - we likely would have made it home safely the same day. The bad things you hear about this hotel are true. I've heard other stories, but never any of them any good. Don't waste your money.

We booked a Penn 5000 Club room which are suppose to be the best rooms and offer seperate check in, seperate lifts and so on. 1. Check in was very rude and seperate check in means if and when open and is a side room wth rude staff. 2. No seperate lifts for Penn 5000 - this is just dishonesty on their website 3. Upon getting to the room, it was awful. Tatty towels and bathroom was disgusting, no views and bedroom very dark and no good lighting. Very tired after a long flight yet could hear everything from room next door. After hard complaining, given another room. 4. Second room equally as bad!! 5. Complimentary breakfast in the \"exclusive lounge\" was just a small dirty room and breakfast was a drinks machine and \"continental\" equated to some muffins 6. We decided to battle it out and checked out after 2 nights and stayed at the Radisson as we just couldnt cope as the hotel was so uncomfortable- not even good enough to take your shoes off! 7. Upon early check out, presented with a bill that included $20 + tax per day for internet use when their internet site states it is free and we specifically phoned up from the UK beforehand to check on this to see whether PC provided in room or whether we needed to take our own laptop. Staff were very rude and accusatory and just completely unhelpful. For the sake of approx $40, you would think for good customer practice they would as a gesture of goodwill remove this charge. Very argumentative staff who havent got a clue about customer service. 8. I didnt authorise payment and told them to call when I got back to the UK yet they left me a message whilst I was still in NY and then charged my card!!

Mixed feelings on the stay. Overall it was not a great experience. The room was a ok size with 2 double beds, with torn bedsheets and linen. Bathroom was a bit small, and quite dirty as well. Location is also ok but nothing great. (it depends on what you want to do ) In terms of the hotel, i would say that if price is a issue its not tooo bad a place to stay however if you can find something along the same price probably take that option. Couple of reasons for the above comment , the caprpet in the room is filthy and is not vaccummed everyday (it was probably done once in the two weeks we stayed there ). In addition housekeeping has no idea what dusting means. Their idea of housekeeping is making the bed and replacing the towels, and literally thats it, dont expect anything more, on a few days they did nto even bother to empty the rubbish bin in the room. While there i also kept my bags permanently locked and kept all valuables in my locked bags, just go this feeling of uneasyness around the place. They do have safety deposit boxes but after you wait for half an hour to try and get a box and no one answer you really wonder if you want to leave valuables in a place like that. The other thing that is quite bad about the hotel is that you have to checkout by 12:00 pm (fair enough) but they charge you $4 storage fee for each bag that you want to leave in their luggage room after you have checked out. (most other hotesl will keep your bags for free) In terms of the staff they are about as usefull as a chocolate teapot. We had people in the room next door smoking on a non smoking floor and the smell kept coming in to our room, When i complained I was told there is nothign we can do maybe housekeeping can spray somehting. (No staff member at that hotel seems to care about anything ) So overall if you are looking for a very basic roof over your head, and basically a place to slepp this place if ok. If you plan on spending time relaxing in the room please book somehwere else, even the bed sheets feel dirty.

The second, third and fourth rooms we were shown were in similar states of disrepair, furniture legs missing, dirty furniture, stale smells in alleged \"non smoking\" rooms etc. We eventually demanded a refund and to be re-located.

The lobby is like the waiting room of a central London train station: impersonal, busy and chaotic. Staff are too few and far between and they are generally rude. In my dark little room I had plaster falling off the walls in chunks. The bathroom was small and had plastic peeling off the base of the shower cubicle. There were rust marks on practically every metal surface. The TV had terrrible reception and was about 15 years old. I had no Kettle, no cups and no safe.

There are scores of decent hotels in New York: don't be duped into staying at this one just because its a bit cheaper and in what looks like a good location if you've never been to NY before. Heed my advice, I've been to the city six times: if you want a youngish trendy scene and lots of bars and cafes stay further south than this (West Village, Soho or Tribeca are best - or if your're feeling extremely trendy and don't mind a bit of grime stay in the East Village, but it's probably not for families) or if you want a more sedate stay go further north and stay in the tres classy upper east somewhere between 55th and 80th on the East Side of Manhattan!

The woman at the reception desk demanded our passports, which we did not have or bring because we are all NY residents. When we handed over our driver's licences she let out a big huff. The rest of the check in was rather normal. We waited about 10 minutes just to get an elevator to the 8th floor even though there are about 12 elevators. We got into our room it was not at all what we expected. The hotel's website says that all of the rooms have been renovated....they definitely werent. Our room looked like the inside of a roach motel, not a $400/night hotel. The lamp shades were not on the lamps and some of the bulbs were completely blackened and burned out. The heaters knobs were broken off and there were no adjustments. We called maintenance since the heater wouldnt turn on. They told us all we could do was plug it in to use it and unplug it to turn it off. So the room would either be blazing hot or freezing cold.

Up to the 6th floor in the fast lift-still impressed- then out into the corridor-OK not quite as nice but still pretty good, strange looking prison cell like doors. Then when I entered my room I realised why it was so cheap. Everything was shabby, the carpet was bare and sticky, the bathroom was dirty and rusty, all in all very dingy. I put my case down and at that moment a mouse scuttled out from under the radiator to see who had disturbed it and then scuttled back again. Just what you want to see in your hotel room! When I complained about it to reception the guy just laughed. I asked to be moved but there were no rooms available. It was just somewhere to rest my head and put up with it as this was secondary to my excitement of being in New York for the first time and seeing all the sights. We had one full day in New York and made the most of it. On the plus side the guy at the hotel tourist desk was very helpful and we booked our open topped bus tour through him. It was fantastic to see all the famous sights and is an experience I will never forget. The only downside is the hotel. The location, as everybody says is perfect and the double bed was actually quiet comfortable and clean. Would I recommend it?

The view was really good and looked over Macy's with the Empire State Building behind it. . During these changes the staff could not have been more helpful. The rooms had maid service every day and the bathroom was always cleaned.

Also we used the Hotel Services desk to book tickets for our bus tour and our boat tour as well as to get some addresses -- they were extremely helpful and patient.

Was not looking forward to the hotel stay as had read the reviews and knew what to expect (which actually helped a lot - I had imagined it eve worse than it is). Starting with the good: Excellent location - can't fault it for accessibility. Check in was fast. New carpets in the hallways (certainly on floors 2 and 14 anyway). New carpet in our room on the 2nd floor, powerful, hot shower, clean bed linen and towels changed daily, no musty smell, no evidence of roaches or mice and no bed bugs. Fantastic view of Empire State Building (and Chrysler) from our room on 14th floor. Most of the bell hops are truly miserable, but if you can find Frank the bellhop he is a wonderful guy - cheerful and helpful and recommended so many good restaurants and places to go and marked them all on a map for us - if only there were more Franks around. The bad: Dim lighting (although this is fairly common in hotels). The bath you would not want to use (in our 2nd floor room) - not dirty but rusty and was OK to put your feet into while having a shower but wouldn't want to lie in it. Incredibly noisy. 2nd floor is so close to the busy street that never stops and there is no double glazing so the noise is incredible. We had ear plugs with us which I would adivse for anyone staying there. Our room on the 14th floor (I'll get to why we had to switch rooms) had filthy carpets which you would not want to put bare feet on (we had slippers) and the plaster was coming away at various points due to damp I would imagine and it did smell musty. The corridoors on the 14th floor were particularly damaged and had crumbling plaster. The ugly: We had 2 connecting doors in our room on the 2nd floor (not to other members of our party). On the first night we were woken at 3am by a man coming back into one of the connecting rooms who was speaking loudly into a mobile phone I presume - but he sounded as if he was in the room with us. OK, I can put up with this, everyone is entitled to make a little noise. However, 2nd night we are woken up at the same time, only this time the guy next door has other males with him (I would say 3 in all) who try to break down the interconnecting door - they weren't just \"testing\" it, there were trying to get in and were shouting too. Quite frightening for two women on their own, half a mile down a coridoor from the elevators. Foolishly perhaps, we didn't do anything (should have called security I know - but to be honest we didn't want to make a noise as I didn't want to confirm that we were women on our own and I wasn't confident that security would come to our aid anyway). Next morning we went to the front desk to ask someone to speak with the people in this room and tell them that if it happened again we would dial 911 immediately. Front desk sent us to security. Security guy spoke with us, didn't take us that seriously (didn't even stand up while talking to us, so rude) told us we should have called security at the time and there was nothing he could do now, and that we shouldn't worry as it is impossible to get into a connecting door from the other room if you have locked your side (fortunately I had checked it when we first got the room and had locked it as it was open). As he could see we were distressed, he did say that he would speak with the deputy duty manager to see if we could move room. Spoke with the ddm, who did not once apologise for what had happened. He gave us the room on the 14th floor and said he thought it didn't have a connecting door. Well, it did, and the room was in so much more dis-repair than the 2nd floor one, but as it was a much quieter room and had a view to die for, and we knew we just wouldn't feel safe back in our old room, we moved. Two other members of our party had to move rooms too - but this was due to mice. No one saw any roaches and no one had any bed bugs. Did it spoil my trip to New York? No way, New York is a truly wonderful city and we had a blast. The galleries and museums (we are an art and design class) are absolutely top rate and we could have spent months looking round them. We had some great experiences and I can't wait to go back with my husband - but we will stay at another hotel if at all possible. If you are booked into the Penn, go prepared.

He advised us of all the right places to go in New York & even gave us vouchers which enabled us to get a free gift from shops in Woodbury Common & Century 21, if we spent over $50.00 there. I had read about staff being unfriendly but from our time there, every member of staff we spoke to were great. They could not have been nicer so i really am wondering about some of the reviews on here about the staff's attitude. We were given a room on the 7th Floor which had 2 double beds in it. As it was not what we booked, (we had booked just the 1 double) we were told we could change rooms the next day if we wished. There is a 'musty' smell in the corriders & probably most of the rooms but i think that is the general smell of the hotel. Don't forget how old this place is. If the smell is a problem in your room (& it really was'nt for us), just buy an airfreshener. Our room, whilst it could have done with a paint job & new carpet, was fine. The bed was more than comfortable (slept like a log everynight), no hint of any bed bugs or anything like that, our towels & bedclothes were changed every day by the maids. The hot & cold water even worked fine!!! What i would advise everyone to do is get a safety deposit box-there is no charge for this.

OH MY GOD! then we read the reviews on this forum we almost about cancelled the booking fearing anything from armed robbery to mould on the walls homeless people sleeping outside the room to septicaemia from the shower if the reviews were to be believed. OK we arrived at 12 noon on the Amtrak at Pen station, the Pen hotel is about 20 seconds away from the station across 7th avenue opposite Madison square gardens in a somewhat lively part of town, to say the least. The hotel says no check in until 3pm but we had no trouble what so ever checking in at 1pm and the member of staff on the check in was polite and very helpful. I explained the fact that I was petrified about staying after reading the reviews on this site to the check in lady an she told me not to worry. We were given room 1369, well it\u2019s the last room from the elevator on that floor but believe me its worth the walk. It\u2019s the corner roomon the block facing the Empire state building and Chrysler tower from one window and towards the world trade (ground zero) centre from the other. From this room you can lay on the bed fall a sleep looking at the empire state building, a really remarkable experience. The room was very big, clean and the bedding was spotless the bathroom was clean and the room had recently had a revamp. Make no mistake this is not a 4 or 5 star room but its not charging 4 or 5 star prices so don\u2019t expect that kind of refinement. The door on the cupboard was too big and would not close, a old refrigerator was bizarrely on the floor in the room but this did not really matter.

I would definitely recommend this hotel the lifts were always empty although the hotel was full which has over 1700 rooms. Lindys diner was delicious with huge portions and Joe O's has the friendliest staff ever and I definitely would book again. Best tip of the holiday: bring your walking shoes as NYC as best way to see all the sites and get to time square (which is only 10 mins away).

Being a city centre hotel (good location then!) the lobby was busy - but the staff were completely disinterested in the customers - there was no organisation - so the whole check in process was a battle and quite stressful. You really had to fight to get attended to cos all the other people were determined to get to the front first! But the most memorable moment, which really is burned into my memory was when my girlfriend and I opened the door to our room. The smell, the stained walls, the fridge that looked like it had belonged to a homeless person (filthy, battered, rusty, empty and incidentally not working), no t.v. filthy carpets and windows that wouldnt open, even a little - all added up to a very strong impression. We were stunned, in an attempt to alleviate the feeling (bear in mind 9 hours travelling led to this) I suggested that perhaps they were expecting us to pay by the hour - but I think my girlfriend thought I meant she looked like a hooker - so it didnt really help! Really, if we had walked into the hotel and been greeted by a receptionist sitting in his stained vest behind a mesh screen (not that I have ever been to a rent by the hour hotel of course) and then been led to this room having been releaved of 20 bucks it may have been ok - but not for what we were paying. A trip back to reception was greeted with indifference - I got the impression the phrase \"I need another room\" was something they heard roughly every four and a half minutes - cos the response was slick - \"this is a city hotel and we are full, there are not rooms\" - not even a sir at the end of the sentence. So we were stuck with it - four nights - little sleep because of the heat and smell, and because the mattress had been mugged away from that homeless person - come to thing of it maybe he was still underneath it, cos boy was there a lump in that mattress. I stay in hotels on business every week - across Europe - and I can honestly say that this is the only hotel stay that is going to stay with me unti I start getting senile - unless of course I caught some dreadful disease when I was in the room and my days are already numbered.......

My advice to ANYONE is not to book things through Expedia. When we arrived at our local airport, we found out that our flight to NYC had been cancelled. The airline (Delta) was very unhelpful since we had booked through Expedia and gave us no other options for different flights going to NYC throughout the day. We went over to the JetBlue desk and the happened to have three seats left that they gave us for cheaper than we paid for Delta. The flight was boarding in ten minutes and the crew made sure that the plane waited until we got on to take off. The flight crew was extremely pleasent to be around and offered my son extra snacks for the much to short plane ride. We had arranged for a shuttle to pick us up through Expedia and when we got off the plane we had to wait an hour and a half for the people to call the shuttle because the \"maximum amount of people\" were not all present. Words to the wise, just take a cab. Most cabs have the flat rate of $50.00 to take you from the airport to wherever you are going in the city, once again cheaper than what we paid for the shuttle. I had read what other reviers wrote before we stayed at hotel Penn, but there was no way that we could cancel on Expedia because we didn't purchase the cancellation policy. We arrived at Hotel Penn a little earlier than check in time and they gave us a room right away. The hallways were old and not very well lit, while the elevators had TV's in them and you couldn't get on them from the lobby unless you showed the man your room key. We got into the room and we were hit with a burst of old moldy air. I walked in and didn't even bother to put our luggage in the room. I got on the phone to call the front desk to see if they had any other rooms available. The front desk MUST know what you are doing because after TEN minutes of waiting for them to pick up, my husband had the idea to just push zero. Tried that and they picked up right away. I asked very politly if they had any other rooms and they said no, even though I was pretty sure they had something else. I had my husband get on the phone and after 30 minutes of back and forth, they agreed to take us to another room. A bellhop came almost immediatly and brought us to five other rooms before we found one that wouldn't kill us if we breathed the air. We somehow got upgraded to a suite that must have been reserved for extremely rich people who decide to stay there, for no extra charge. There were two double beds with a large old desk and some light. The bathroom was filled with mold and not cleaned, but the water was ok for taking showers. The room was still moldy and dusty as all the others were, but at least it was spacious. My son tried to open the window (we were facing a building so no view) and the blinds came tumbling down on top of him. The air worked, but you had to give it some time. We ate at the little resteraunt downstairs and that was OK, nothing fancy just a little burger joint. It was a few minutes away from Time Square and was right across the street from Penn Station, Macys, Old Navy, Madison Square Gardens, and the Empire state building. There is also a subway station right underneath the hotel! I would definitly stay there again if they managed to clean up the rooms tremendously and maybe changed the towels once in a while. It was a GREAT location, however I don't see us staying there again this summer!

WHAT A SHOCK! The first room we were given was tiny, a 4 foot 6 bed just fitted in, there was nowhere to put our cases. The room was damp, dirty, and there was a horrible smell coming from somewhere. A large section of the bathroom door had actually started to rot/rust away. WORST HOTEL ROOM I'VE EVER SEEN! We approached the desk clerk and told her that we were not prepared to stay there, only to be told that there wasn't much else available, as it was a saturday night. We stated that if not, then we would stay in a top Hotel, and ensure that either the Penn, or expedia - who we had booked through - would pay for it. Suddenly a room was made available, on the same floor as the other (the 5th Floor - 559). This room was by far superior, much bigger, huge bed, and a cleaner bathroom. There were resident mice sharing our room, and I noticed under the air-conditioning unit a lot of dust and dirt. Only 1 pillow each, and not many towels, so I tipped the maid, and the following day we had an extra pillow each, and more towels. The pillows remained for the duration of our stay, but unfortunately the towels didn't. The rest of the Hotel was pretty much run down and grubby. Apparently they are having a refit, and looking on the Penn's own website this is evident as the rooms they advertise look very modern and clean - however throughout the week I saw only 2 Contractors. The Penn is nearly a hundred years old, so I reckon it'll take these 2 men another hundred years to do the refit. On a plus side - we were able to use the Penn as our base to wander off and look at the many other \"better quality and just as cheap\" hotels in the area, so we know where to stay next time now. Staff were quite ignorant and rude, apart from the Maids. The Security is not quite as advertised - Keys were rarely checked for residents using the lifts to go up to the floors; and the hotel advertises CCTV on all floors - the floors are huge, with lots of Corridors - only 1 camera on each floor, right by the lifts! I doubt if anybody was watching it anyway! I had noticed during the week that there was a lot of Flight Crew from various Airlines staying in certain areas on our floor (5th). On check-out day, I took the opportunity to bribe staff to let me see these rooms, which to my amazement were excellent!! If I didn't know better I would say that the Hotel were looking after the guaranteed \"money\" of the Airline Company's, and giving the Tourists the poor rooms - but then maybe..... Either way, we won't be staying here again!!!!!! It's a massive shame, the hotel has a lot of history, and you can see where the once Grandeur stood. It's just been allowed to fall into disarray. You wouldn't believe it was owned by the same people as the Waldorf Astoria. At most, a 1 - Star hotel. A few tips: If you're not 100% happy with your room, DO change it! If they say no other rooms are available, ask to see the Manager, or say you'll go somewhere better and charge it to them. Food at Lindy's is average, and expensive. There's a couple of Breakfast places just up the street past Macy's. Don't go by the Penn's own web site otherwise you will be very disappointed.

My mother and I looked online and saw that Hotel Pennsylvania had a reasonable rate and was in a good location. I arrived at the hotel late Monday night and stepped out of the cab into a rather motley mix of people, some not so appealing looking. But I chalked that up to the area probably being a hangout for teenagers and whatnot. I walked into the lobby and it was the same thing. I wasn't worried, however. Sure there were more random people walking around the hotel than I was used to, but it was near a station after all. Most hotels would ask non-patrons and loiterers to leave... but I shrugged it off. In the midst of my check in, a man came up to the front desk yelling about some problem that was supposed to have been resolved already. He had an unfamiliar accent so I couldn't make out just what the issue was. I did notice, however, that the front desk girl conducted herself rather unprofessionally. But I figured it was late so she was probably tired and frustrated by now. I wrote it off. I headed for the elevators where I had to show my room key before I could even enter the elevator area. This was the point where I actually first braced myself. While this sounds like a comforting security measure, I've been to hundreds of hotels all around the world and have never seen such a practice. I found myself a little wary wondering why they would need such a precaution. Maybe the area wasn't as safe as Time Square where I usually stay. When I stepped off the elevator and onto the 4th floor, I knew with a sinking feeling that my time there would not be pleasant. I was hit with a rush of stale cigarette smoke. Apparently my non-smoking room was on a smoking floor which rather negated its efficacy. The hall carpet looked as though its original color was buried underneath quite a few layers of dirt and grime. Stains large and small were everywhere. I was a little frightened of seeing so many stains considering that the lighting was inordinately dim and further hampered by a mist of smoke. If that's what I could see, how much was I missing? Many of the directional signs to the rooms where hand drawn as quite a few of the signs had fallen off probably long ago. What was even more fun for me, there were no signs to my room at all. I had to roam the dark, dank hallway aimlessly. Fortunately I found it just before I was about to go downstairs to complain. Many of the doors to the rooms were covered with some sort of green, plastic decoration. It's hard to describe, but they were obviously old and tattered. Quite a few of the doors were missing them and the ones that were still hanging often had holes. I arrived in my room only to find that my carpet was filthier than the carpet in the hallways. So filthy was it that I never took off my shoes. There was a double bed with an obviously worn bedspread, an armchair about 30 years old that looked as though it had never been cleaned in all that time, and a desk that looked only a few years old but that had a chair whose cushion was already covered in stains. As I walked in I immediately smelled the musky odor of mold, and soon I found ONE of its sources. There was a little mini-fridge of the floor with black mold visible on the outside of it. I was horrified. I timidly entered the bathroom hoping for a bright spot but afraid of something worse. The towels and washclothes were folded on what looked like the type of bathroom shelving you'd find in a high school locker room. The problem was that the holes that were part of the shelving design, probably meant to prevent water buildup, were full of rust and dirt. Apparently noone at this hotel had ever heard of LYSOL (fortunately I had and came armed with a bottle). I read one review where someone walked into a room there and it reeked of bleach, they were appalled. Me, I only wish I'd had the smell of bleach in my room. I gingerly pulled back the shower curtain to spray the area with Lysol, only to find that no amount of Lysol would convince me to bathe myself in such a place. There was no plug for the drain so I could clearly see the corroded, rusted, and dirt encrusted area around and inside it. The enamel on the tub was cracked and peeling in many places, creating partially opened crevices where it was impossible to clean. Maybe if the whole thing had been soaked in pure bleach..... From what I saw, either the tub wasn't cleaned after the last guest (or few guests) or whoever cleaned it didn't know how to do their job. To be fair, maybe they were just as grossed out as I was a preferred to avoid it. All I wanted to do was survive till morning when I could find other accommodations. I went to the window to close the curtains (my room looked into another room) and I happened to glance down at the ancient fan/heater attached to the wall. To my horror and nausea even now, the vent was filled with mold, grime, dirt and only the Lord knows what else. It was black with layer upon layer of filth. Absolutely disgusting and I'm sure a health hazard and code violation of some sort. It's just as well the window was stuck and didn't close because I felt I would rather freeze all night than even let my pinky touch the dial on that contraption. And I did. I spent a restless night hearing people come down the fire escape through my hopelessly ajar window. I'll try to cut this longwinded story short on only mention in passing things like the stains on the inside of the bedspread, the filthy ironing board, the lack of a bolt lock on the door, and the fleas. Needless to say I hightailed it out of there early in the morning. I checked out a couple of housekeeping carts on my way out and noticed that there were no cleaning products whatsoever. There were only refills of toilet paper and changes of linen. Actually, this place was such that you had to put a sign on your door saying that you wanted them to clean the room to get service at all. They have a $50 early check out fee that got waived for me, which is just as well for them as I was appalled enough to make my complaints known which is something I'm usually loathe to do. I ended up staying at the Comfort Inn on 46th St. which turned out to be $10 cheaper a night, almost on the corner of Times Square, closer to my interview, and CLEAN. Granted, I had just left hell so anything else felt like heaven. I know others have mentioned that their in the midst of renovating and that some of the rooms are ok. But as for me, I wouldn't take the risk.

It seems most of the good reviews go for suites or rooms on the 13th floor but if you consider the size of the hotel you're really taking a chance on getting a good room! We booked a non-smoking room with a queen-sized bed and found the room to be quite small. This was not a problem compared to the dirty, worn out carpets and the fact that all soft furnishings were impregnated with a stench of stale smoke. There were prominent mould colonies in the bathroom and our room overlooked a brick wall barely a street-width apart. The highlight was the bedside lamp which was operated by sitting on the bed!

However, as soon as we got there I was relieved to find it is a great hotel. Firstly, I think people who spend a lot of time in hotels expect a certain level of service and this hotel does not provide anything other than the room. You get your room, en-suite bathroom and TV. No breakfast, room service, massage, gym or any other extras that you don't really need. The hotel is right in the middle of everything however. Empire State Building, Macys and Times Square are within a short walk away. Penn Station (and Subway access) and Madison Square Gardens are opposite the hotel. We arrived at Newark Airport, got the monorail tram from the terminals to the train station at the airport. Train ride to Penn Station and then we crossed the road and we were there. No expensive bus or taxi journeys and hardly any walking. The staff are nice and friendly and helpful. This hotel is perfect for anyone who is going to New York for the first time and is looking for somewhere decent and cheap to stay in the middle of everywhere. This is a functional hotel and will meet all your needs and which is all you need on a trip. Anything its missing you can find in the city anyway. Like I said if this is your first trip or you have been before and just want a room to sleep in then this is perfect. If your use to the better things in life than this hotel is not for you. Some tips. 1. Book on the hotels own website early as you can see how much each type room is for each day. It may be cheaper to go a week earlier. I could not beat the deal the hotel offered on the website depsite searching all the websites that supposdely offer cheaper deals. Also booking with the hotel direct apparently gets you a decent room or upgraded to better. Lindys diner in the hotel lobby is hyped but seemed expensive and very little choice. Much better is an Italian resturant called Sbarrow which is 2min walk away from the hotel (turn right as you come out the main entrance). Food is on paper plates but they do a hot breakfast buffet for $7 with really nice food (but get there early). Oh and don't drink tea anywhere!

It should be turned into a hostel. I have included photos - you can compare them to the deceptive photos and wording on the Hotel Pennsylvania website. Bad Points: - Blatant False Advertising (Website is extremely deceptive, claiming \u201cInside, you'll find beautifully renovated rooms, with new furniture and carpeting\u201d. But only a few suites have been redecorated. Standard rooms definitely do not match the website photos). - Terrible \u201chotel\u201d rooms. After reading the Tripadvisor reviews, we requested a renovated room, but our request was completely ignored. - Broken bed in our first room, meant that reluctantly they moved us to second, equally appalling room. - Extremely dated interior (15 years +) - Stained and worn-out carpet - Smells of cigarette smoke - Chunks of flaking ceiling paint falling off (really nice to wake up to) - Faded wall-paper peeling off - Marks, stains, and writing on walls. - Paint missing from doors to each room (looked like they had all been broken into) - Light switch hanging off of wall (dangerous) - Bathrooms not cleaned properly (walls, door and shelves had scum, toilet was unflushed) - Bathroom Linen had holes and stains - Bed Linen had dirt marks. - Shower swamped water over bathroom floor - Buttons on phone did not work properly (reported to reception, but nothing done) - Noisy air-conditioning - No room service or mini-bar - No breakfast included - Huge Security Problem (guy sitting by elevators lets every single person through without checking for room keys). - 1700 rooms, but only usually 2 staff on reception desk. Therefore long, slow moving queues. - Extremely Poor Customer Service (no point complaining, they have clearly heard it many, many times before). - $4 fee per bag for storage on depature day. - $50 fee for early departures (Seems this has been a real problem for them. Once people see the rooms, they realise that they have been ripped off, and want to check out. So the hotel has turned this into a money making opportunity! Good Points: - Location (opposite Madison Square Garden, 1 block from Macy\u2019s, 15 minute walk to Time Square, close to clothes shops) - Transport (above Penn Station / red subway line, 1 block from yellow subway line) - Cheaper than a Hilton or Marriott hotel. - Nice Lobby (doesn\u2019t match the rest of the hotel) - If you are prepared to spend even more, you can get a renovated suite Recommendations: - Only consider this hotel if you are on a very, verty strict budget. - Under no circumstances should you book a standard room (refer to the photos). The condition of the rooms and bathrooms in a hostel will be far superior to this dump. This place has so many terrible ratings on Tripadvisor\u2026 how could so many people be wrong? They are not!

Upon entering the room I noticed that the windows were open the reason soon being obvious \u2013 there was a musty smell from damp (not sure where water was coming in from).

However, my stay was very nice. The location is hard to beat, as is the price for a hotel in NYC. We were checked-in quickly. We were on the 9th floor, which looked fine to me. The hallways were not at all \"dark and scary\". They were very wide and accomodating, and while not very bright, were far from scary. The carpet reminds me of some older resort-type hotels in the Caribbean. The doors to the rooms are weird, but very secure...I don't think anyone could break into them very easily! Our room was very small, though not as small as some rooms in Europe I've been in, and we faced another wall just like ours, which did not make for a nice view, but was great for quietness at night...hardly any street noise at all. But, we weren't there for the view anyway. The bed was clean and the sheets/towels were changed every day. The matress, while thin, was not lumpy or uncomfortable at all, and I am a very light sleeper, and very ticky about my creature-comforts. I do not like the new-type beds in some modern hotels that are simply a matress on top of a wooden box...this bed had real box-springs. The carpet, while thin and old, was OK, and the room had no odors at all. The room was overheated at first, which we solved by turning the (very old) wall heater off, and cracking the window a bit. The windows also had blackout curtains, which really kept out the light, even though they were nothing to look at. The bathroom was very clean, though the paint was peeling behind the door (it had been repainted without being sanded...a waste of time and effort). The tub was HUGE and made of old-fashioned porcelain...a great soaking tub! The water pressure was fantastic and we always had tons of hot water. The sink is a pedestal kind, but there is a \"marble\" ledge under the mirror to put your stuff on, so there was room enough to spread out a bit. Our only problem was the TV wouldn't work. We informed the front desk and everything was fine when we returned to the room a few hours later. We also had a clock-radio. The room was cleaned every day in a timely manner, and we never heard a maid knocking or screaming \"maid service!\" at early hours, which is more than I can say about several $500 a night hotels where I've stayed! The cleaning staff were all friendly and spoke to me each time I saw them. There is a \"security\" guy stationed downstairs by the elevators and you're supposed to show your room key for elevator access, even though we were never asked after the first time. I never felt unsafe (and I am female and was traveling w/ another female) at any time. Also, there are 12 (!) elevators, so we never had to wait more than about 30 seconds to get one. The lobby is huge and bustling at all hours, and there is a good coffee shop. There is a Lindy's for bar service, which I thought was over-priced, but better than nothing. There are always plenty of taxis outside since the entrance is across from Penn Station...also great access to the subways from there or Herald Square. There is a deli across 34th Street, a newstand next to Penn Station, a K-Mart across the street, and you can walk to Times Square if you want...super location. I never saw an insect or rodent of any kind, nor did I ever get the feeling that there were any around. I was very pleased with my stay.

My boyfriend and I needed a cheap place to stay to go see the Maury Show. The hotel Pennsylvania, at 153 dollars a night, was the cheapest we could find, and just happens to be where the Maury Show is located. Check in was fast. I asked about being upgraded to a renovated room and they said \"we don't have renovated rooms, we used to, but the 12th and 13th floors now belong to businesses.\" I think she was just feeding me a line of bull, because 2 nights beforehand I had called to ask for a renovated room and they said they only give renovated rooms to people who books directly through them. I had booked through hotels (hi louis!). Hotels saved me only 6 dollars over booking directly with the hotel pennsylvania, and by booking with hotels I was guaranteed NOT to get a renovated room. Anyway... I have no idea what's up with the renovated rooms. So on with the review. We were on the 7th floor. Our view was a brick wall. The room appeared clean enough although the room was a bit drab. Literally 2 beds and a TV. Nothing more. The bathroom was acceptable, the shower worked fine. There was only \"conditioning shampoo\" and no conditioner so bring your own, ladies. I'd asked for one bed but we got two.. I didn't fuss. We like getting close. The location is right in the center of everything (penn station, madison sq. garden, times square, the fashion district). Everything is insanely expensive around here but luckily Louis at Hotels was able to give us some advice about how to get things cheap. To sum it up: we weren't expecting luxury and we certainly didn't get luxury. This hotel is great if you're looking for something cheap, and if you're not planning to stay very much in the hotel room at all. If you're staying in NYC for more than one or two nights I'd cough up the dough for a nicer hotel. I wasn't disappointed as I knew what to expect from a 2 star... but this was easily the oldest looking, least renovated appearing, dreary hotel I've ever stayed in. Don't let the shiny pictures of the hotel lobby fool you. This is not a hotel where you go \"ooooh, aaaah!\" it's a hotel where you crash for the night and get the heck out!

Once the elevator doors open at your floor, the scene changes drastically. I cannot speak for every floor but the one I was on had burnt out lights, peeling wallpaper (yes it was actually hanging off the wall in a giant flap), and grubby stained carpet. The room looked no better with its drab color scheme and worn appearance. The floor was exceptionally hard (no padding I suspect) and the bath was badly in need of updating. The linen and bathroom cleanliness was acceptable but the condition of the rest of this building suggests that the Penn was ready for the wrecking ball years ago. Avoid this place at all costs!

I am really suprised at some of the reveiws on this website - and i must admit they made me a little aprehensive before i went. Basically you get what you pay for in New York. Our room was 1518A (15th floor) - clean and comfortable and quiet. Nice view over Madison Square Gardens. Apparently you are much better off with a room above the 13th floor (they have been refurbed). Yes the corridors were a bit shabby and the hotel does generally need a refurb, but how much time are you going to spend in your hotel anyway. The room was cleaned to a high standard everyday and we had lots of fresh clean towels. We did leave the chambermaid a nice tip at the end of the stay as she did a great job. This was our second trip to NYC. We last stayed at the Amsterdam Court on 50th Street. However i would thoroughly recommend the Hotel Penn on location and price - around the corner from Macys and Empire State and opposite Penn Station. One warning - we were ripped off in the Irish Bar within the hotel. Gave $50 for 2 drinks and was only given change for $20. Lucky i noticed and they gave the correct change straight away - seemed to us to be a bit of a scam as they readily gave me the correct change and could hardly bare to say sorry!! Needless to say we didn't go back. One great tip - to get cheap tickets for Broadway show go to the OTHER TKTS booth at South Street Seaport - unlike the one in Times Square - there was no queue.

Times Square has a Ticket shop in the middle - Queue early. They open at 10:00 to sell cheaper tickets for the daily shows - we saw Chicago at a 35% reduced price. Empire States Building - no queues if you go at 08:00 when they open, but make sure it is a nice day as the vioews are fantastic. Canal Street is where you can buy your designer (but not at designer price) hand bags. Go on a coach tour of the film and tv locations - we wish we had done it at the start as it is great to see everywhere and really cheap.

My only gripe (and I never thought I would complain about this as the opposite is usually typical) is that the shower was too powerful in our room - I mean almost painful to stand under especially if you are, ahem, a male!! Secondly, the bedding never seemed to stay on very well and wasn't adequate for my liking (in the UK we usually get duvets and so I guess I'm used to this)- my travelling companion didn't mind this and so I guess it just depends on you. We had no problem with the staff - we had mistakenly booked a standard room (this means a room with a double bed) and we were quickly changed to a room with two singles. The deposit box service is also very useful and free (unless you lose your key, in which case you have to pay $100)although I did occasionally have to wait a while for staff to come and serve me in the little safety deposit box room.

Our first room was on the 6th floor. It was in a corner with two windows. Our beds were below the windows and there was a majorly cold draft coming in from them. We turned on the heat and couldn't seem to get a happy medium in the way of tempurature. If the heat was on, it was on full blast. Then we all thought we'd shower. Well, the shower would only give cold water. No hot water coming from the shower. So we call and the poor maintenance man (he was very nice. He was sick with a cold and was the only maintenance person working for the entire hotel). He told us there was a broken mechanism and that it couldn't be fixed that evening. So he called the front desk and tried to get us a new room. He advised us that there were none available. He was able to get us a room to simply shower in. Thank God! That room was as disgusting as ours, with stains on the carpet, crud in all the corners and a shower stall from what one might find in one of those hotels that rents rooms by the week! I felt sorry for my feet down there on the dirty shower stall floor! So we stayed the night in that room. We called the front desk the following day to try and get a new room. After repeat phone calls, and an attempt to ignore us by not picking up their phones (they must have caller I.D. because they knew which room was calling them) we finally got the keys to a new room. This room was no different from our first room. Nastiness in all the corners, stains on the carpet, falling curtains, a crummy shower stall, no plug ins in the bathroom, and barely any plug ins in the room...To sum it up, it was horrible (in capital letters!) The location is nice but the rooms and front desk staff were the pits. I would not waste money staying there.

We checked in after 1am and were shown to our room by a very enthusiastic bell boy. Unfortunately the room was horrible. With it being so late, we decided to wait until the morning to change. The room smelt awful, was very small and poorly laid out (the tv stand was at the side of the bed) and the walls were dirty and in a poor state of repair. We went to the desk in the morning where we learnt that it was in fact a smoking room. THis angered me because I had gone to the trouble of e-mailing the hotel with my name and booking reference to ask for a non-smoking room, only to be told that most rooms were non-smoking, and you wouldn't be given a smoking room unless you asked. It was a slap in the face therefore to be tols by the clerk that I should have specified non-smoking on our arrival. Our next room was much better, though not great. It was larger and cleaner and did not smell. THe bathroom was much better as well. On our third night, our neighbour decided to play loud music after 11pm. We called reception, and the music was turned off promptly. At 1.45am, the music returned. Once again, we called, and the music was turned off. UNfortunately, there was an additional noise which drove us mad. We never did discover what it was, but it sounded like a pneumatic drill going for 2 seconds, every 9 seconds, from somewhere outside, which had been going since we returned to our room. THe repetitiveness of it was maddening, and it was impossible to sleep. At 3:30 we gave up and went down to reception, who could only suggest changing rooms. We tried another room, but the noise coul dbe heard there as well, so back downstairs we went. The next room was quiet, but was a smoking room again, so we went down again, at our wit's end. FOrtunately, the next room was both quieter and free from odour and we managed to get to sleep around 4.30am. I must point out that the lady on the desk was very helpful and did not seem to mind us continually returning to her. We do not know if the noise was within the control of the hotel or not, but it was gone by the morning and did not return on our fourth night. THe best thing about the hotel is its location, and its relative cost. It was the most expensive hotel we stayed at, and yet the worst. I guess that's NYC for you.

The hallway was creepy and became darker the further in we went. The carpets were dirty and the wallpaper was coming off the wall several places. Hotel Pennsylvania was quickly renamed Hotel Trannsylvania, by which it is still referred to. However, the room was actually better than we had feared. The bathroom was clean (although water was constantly dripping into the bathtub), and we were given fresh towels and sheets every day. The heater/AC worked fine, but made a lot of noise! So much that we, because the windows were badly isolated and it was sooo cold!, decided to get drunk so that we would get some sleep while the heater was on. (a good, old Norwegian trick) Oh well.

There are carpets on all the floors, both in the rooms and in the hallways, and they are rarely - if ever - vacuumed. I had an allergic reaction almost immediately after entering the room; luckily I had brought antihistamins, and I continued taking these every day of my stay in this hotel, which definitely saved our holiday. I also used a lot more asthma medicine while staying here, although this probably also was caused by the cold weather. At last, I have included a very funny picture from our room in Trannsylvania. It is of a HUGE orange .. err, thing, that was placed on the top of the closet. It had no function whatsoever, it was just a very ugly ball-shaped sort of decoration that collected a lot of dust.

So after asking for a manager and reporting the whole mess, we were put in the 'penthouse'. Oh. My. Gosh. If this penthouse is still in the same condition, it should just be opened as a homeless shelter. No, not good enough, a pig sty. The place obviously hadn't been vacuumed, dusted, mopped, wiped down, etc. in months. The windows had a coat of grime so thick we could write messages like it was snow. And, best part, there was a fridge smaller than the one I kept in my dorm room. If you are planning a 'trash-your-hotel-room' party, this is your place. If you want a hotel where you don't have to wear your shoes in the room (and the shower), then stay elsewhere.

Our room was on the 12th floor so it's possible that it may be one of the rooms that have been refurbished. If you're expecting something fancy, don't. It's simply an older hotel that is located in a centrally located spot. Penn Station is literally across the street. We took the LIRR (railroad) in from the airport and it was a breeze!

We then read some of the reviews on this site and wondered what we had done. On arriving we were ready to ask for rooms on a higher floor straight away as we heard thats where the refurbishing had been done but we had been booked into the 15th floor so thought we would give it a try first, as the young chinese girl on the desk was very pleasent and helpful ( as others had commented ) and we had not had to wait very long to see her which was a good start. On stepping out of the lift we found the decor and carpeting to be shabby so were a bit apprehensive but carried to see what was in store. On reaching the first room we opened the door to see the room was also shabby but seemed fairly clean and quite a good size. I then opened the blind and werestunned by the view - straight across the rooftops to the Empire State Building most unexpected and suddenly the aprehension dissappeared. The second room had the same view and although shabby was also plenty large enough and clean. We stayed for 4 nights and found the room had been cleaned when we came back in the evenings and all the towels changed and the beds made up so there were no complaints on that score. The showers are the fiercest I have ever come across but certainly wake you up and tone your skin. We tried the restaraunt on the first night but would not recomend it as there are so many cheaper places within a few hundred yards giving better sevice and as good if not better food. ( for breakfast turn right outside the doors, cross the road and there are several small places serving anything you could want between them at very reasonable prices. The location is superb - you can walk to Time Square, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, Macys - next door, The Heliport, United Nations building etc + the station is only a matter of feet from the entrance so anywhere in Manhatten is accessable - easily. All in all we really enjoyed our stay and were not let down by the hotel. I think if you have stayed in old hotels in europe you will know what to expect and not be too dissapointed - we wouldn't pay double the price for better decor and newer carpet. We can understand why there are complaints as we moved on to Washington and stopped in the Red Roof Inn in Chinatown which is fairly new and has massive rooms - definatly a step up and no more expensive - but the streets of Chinatown in Washington are much more threatening at night than those of Manhatton so there are drawbacks to eveything.

Believe all of the other reviews you read about this hotel - it was AWFUL! There is no other word to describe it. However, there is a positive side - if you want to see it! Despite arriving jet lagged to see a shabby lobby full of slightly lost looking grungey back-packer / hostel types loitering around, and then getting up to the room, which was a mix of everything everyone else in their reviews has described and then promptly feeling like we wanted to break down into hysterical sobs of tears, we managed to recover and resign ourselves to the fact that it was only a 2* hotel, which we had known all along and we got on with it. The positives are 1). its location - you really couldn't complain about that 2). it was room only so there was no need to eat there 3). it really was so awful that it made us want to stay out all day and night, so we took in everything literally that NYC had to offer! By the end of our 5 night stay, we were even kind of sad to leave the 'Translyvania' in an oddly macabre kind of way! It really is something out of the railroad era - and I found that quite fascinating - certainly looks like it hasn't been decorated since then! And check out all of the cupboards in the bedrooms - we had 5 - 3 of which led on from one another like a labyrinth, plus a weird door which wouldn't open but which appeared to lead into the next room - Mad! However, whilst we managed the trip on a budget (and the choice of hotel was all part of that plan) next time I go to NYC i'll definitely fork out the extra few dollars for somewhere a bit plusher!

After reading the reviews on the website we were some what sceptical but thought we would give it a go. It was as we had expected for 2 star accommodation in central New York. The lobby was impressive but the rooms did not reflect this. Our sink was wobbly and the furniture old. You could also hear people in the room next door when you and they were in the bathroom. The rooms need updating but the room was clean, the bed massive and we always had hot water. For the two hours a day we were in our room, it was fine. There are also safety deposit boxes at the hotel reception for which you get your own key which was better than leaving cash in the room. Tips for whilst you are in New York as a first time visitor.... * only use yellow cabs especially at the airport. We made the mistake of accepting the offer of a cab from a guy waiting at arrivals. As we thought this was the norm we followed him. It was only after we walked past the yellow cabs that we thought something was dodgy. The guy wanted over $80 for a one way ride. The yellow cabs are $45. Don't let him persuade you different. We got out of his car and into a yellow cab. * Ladies, take flat shoes!!! the hotel is a good walk from Times Square when in heels. Unless you want to taxi everywhere, which can get exspensive, take flat shoes. *Buy a Grey Line city loops bus pass in conjunction with a New York pass, you will be able to go into most tourist attractions, museums etc for a lot cheaper than paying for them individually. The bus pass lets you on and off of the guided buses as much as you like and includes the ferry ride to the Statue of Liberty. * Buy tickets for Broadway shows from the ticket marque in the middle of Times Square on the day you want them and get them half price, if not you will pay \u00a335 approx each ticket for the back row. Overall this was a great holiday, make sure you read up on New York before you go so you have an idea of how much you should be paying for things and what you want to do/see", "Date": "September 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "S.F., Ca", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel Ever\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3910430", "Content": "This was by far the worst place I have ever stayed.

Two: Anybody who actually visits NYC and spends more time in the hotel room than sleeping/showering is in the wrong city. Details: Our room was pretty threadbare admittedly but the sheets and towels were clean and changed every day. The AC was fine if a little noisy. It also leaked but as the damp patch was just under the window, we didnt bother informing the staff until we were leaving (for the record, they rang somebody immediately to fix it). We also saw a roach in the bathroom (just once) but again, its a 2 star hotel in a pretty old building. The location is of course perfect, directly across from Madison Square Gardens and right beside a subway station. Plenty of good places for eating if a little staid for nightlife.

This was truly one of the worst places I have ever stayed in. Finding a cheap room in Manhattan is always a challenge, so I decided to take a chance because the rate was so low. The fun started when I entered the smoky lobby (I guess they aren't abiding by the city's no-smoking laws). This hotel is popular with tour groups because of the low rates, so the place was mobbed and the check-in line was very long. I waited at least 30 minutes. When I got to my room, I was literally speechless from the shock. The bed had no headboard and was simply a box spring and mattress pushed against the wall. The room was tiny. Maybe I could have lived with both of those things. Then I noticed that the top drawer of the bureau was open, and when I tried to close it, it wouldn't budge; it was stuck and would not move in either direction. I opened the second drawer, and there was dirt inside it--we are talking about half an inch of dirt, as if someone had just poured it in. I am not exaggerating. I called the front desk, told them the room was unacceptable and asked for another. First the front desk clerk said they were completely booked. I said that the bureau was not usable, and that not all of the guests had arrived yet, so surely she could find me another room. She grudgingly told me to come downstairs, where I had to wait another half hour on line to change my room. This was one a bit better. There was no dirt in the bureau, the drawer worked and the bed actually had a headboard. It was still tiny, and would have been OK just for me, but when my husband joined me in a few days, it was pretty tight. Although the room wasn't outwardly dirty, there was something about it that didn't give me a clean feeling; perhaps I was just still traumatized froom viewing the first room!

My husband being a doctor, told the woman that our two daughters had asthma ( wich they dont) and were coughing and sneezing from all the mold and dust. I guess they were afraid of a lawsuit because they called us back in 5 minutes and told us that they had a room for us on the 16th floor. We went up there and the man was very nice and apologized over and over again for the other room. The new room was very spacious, had a tv, 2 queen size beds, a large bathroom and a desk along with a cot. The man told us that this room was a superior upgrade and was usually reserved for Hotel Penn members but he felt bad and decided to give it to us for free of upgrade charge. He even told us to go down to the front desk and recieve the citypass books that he reserved for us. We stayed for 5 nights and after the second night we sort of got used to it. Although the blinds broke on the windows and there was pubic hair all over the bathroom from guest before us, the maids brought fresh towels everyday and were very understanding when my 3 yr old had a accident in the cot and brought us fresh sheets right away.

That tiny stinky hole only had one very little bed (not even queen size) in it. So I picked up the phone and asked how all of this was possible.

My girlfriend waited in front of that room with our luggage (of course they did not offer us any help with our bags) while I talked to the concierge who did not know anything about a new room.

We had an extra ironing room with a seperate door which was a little odd but not something to complain about! The service at the hotel was good - alpharooms booked us a king bed room when our invoice said a twin bedded room but the reception staff happy exchanged the rooms and on the one occassion that the room was not cleaned (because we were in it) we rang housekeeping late in the evening and they quickly brought up new towels. Basically this hotel is not somewhere to be scared of. If you want a room to sleep in, a place to take a shower and recover from the day then it is totally fine.

There was always lots of people in the lobby at whatever time of day we went through there, but I suppose that was due to it being mid December and a busy period. LOTS of irate guests around! We had booked a 'superior' room rather than a standard. The woman on reception gave us our room key and we went up to find it, when we opened the door we could not believe what we saw! DISGUSTING! constantly running tap in the bathroom, filthy carpets, TINY bed, and it STUNK of smoke. Well we went straight back down to reception and started to queue again. But a porter spotted us and said 'oh, you two complaining about your room? Come straight to the front of the queue - you don't have to queue twice.' So we saw the woman again and complained that the room was disgusting and demanded a better room. (on the way down in the lift we talked with another English couple who were on their way to say the same thing! Apparently its pretty common practice for them to put you in a crappy room first and wait to see if you complain.) So anyway, woman on reception said 'booking a superior room doesn't guarantee you one. There are none available, sorry.' So my boyfriend got very angry at this - at which point she glanced at the computer and an available superior room MIRACULOUSLY appeared to become available. She gave us these new keys and THAT room was a world apart. Huge queen size bed, big TV, clean. It was like a different hotel. The lesson to be learned from this experience - complain until they give you a satisfactory room! They give the nicest rooms to the ones willing to fight for them, and believe me, you do NOT want to see the horrendous state of their worst rooms. Be prepared for a lot of running up and down between rooms and reception desk - NOT the most relaxing start to your holiday after a long flight. Also I remember a school trip of girls staying in our corridoor running up and down and screaming all night long, and leaving toilet roll scattered around outside. Having said all that, the breakfast was yummy, and it was handy for the subway - but not in my opinion a 'fantastic location.' VERY touristy area. There were other English people everywhere!

After reading previous reviews, we booked our room thru the hotel's website. I called the hotel before booking to ask about getting a renovated room, and the lady told me that it would be guaranteed if I book the superior king size room thru their website. If I booked thru other discount websites it will only be a run of the house room, ie not renovated. When I booked the superior king size room thru their website, it ended up being way cheaper with an AAA discount then booking thru expedia for a regular unrenovated room. And we were guaranteed a renovated room, or so they say. We were definitely apprehensive before we arrived and were ready to do battle to get a renovated room, but when we got there it wasn't that bad at all. We arrived at 12:30pm, waited about 10-15 minutes to check in. To help out with the line, the lady took us to the Penn 5000 club room to check in. We told the lady we wanted to make sure it was a renovated room and she said that we did book for one and she is looking for a renovated floor. She found us a room on the 10th floor. She then mentioned they may not have had time to clean the room yet since check out was at 12pm, but she will make sure someone cleans it very soon if that was the case. She even paged the maids on that floor while we were there to make sure. When we got to the room, which was not hard to find at all, it was already cleaned! It was a renovated room, smaller that we anticipated based on the web site pictures, but had the same bed and bedcovers as shown on the website for that size room and was clean and decent enough for a 2-3 stars hotel. The bathroom was not the newest, but was clean and there was no mold or dripping taps or hair in sinks etc. We had hot water anytime we wanted it, no problem with water pressure, clean towels, clean sheets and new soaps everyday. The only downsides we had were the air con was not very cold when we were hot, and our room faces another hotel wing, so we had to have our curtains closed all the time. I can definitely see the air con becoming an issue during the summer. Since it was not that hot while we were in NY, the air con was good enough for us. While we were there I barely heard other guests on the floor, except for the shower running next door (We must have been lucky on that floor) We never had to wait more than 20 seconds for the elevators either, though we mostly used them after 12pm and after 8pm. There were always a ton of people in the lobby, but I did not witness lineups that may take hours to check in in the regular check in. One group line up was quite big on the memorial holiday weekend. Overall we were quite satisfied with the hotel, especially considering what we paid per night. It was about $30 less than the cheapest room on expedia. The location is excellent. Easy access to the subway stations, quick walk to Times Square and tons of shopping all around. For the price you cannot beat the location and value for money as one reviewer said, spend your money elsewhere while in New York. Know that you are only paying for a 2-3 stars hotel, don't expect 5 stars and book thru the hotel website. It will save you many a headache!

I went down to the front desk and told tem i was not happy and was not prepared to stay in the room. With no further questions i was moved to a kingsize room! This to was fairly disgusting, stains everywhere again, but no dripping tap, and it was a front facing room so we looked straight down on the Madisson Garden complex, this really made up for the problems.

I was nervous arriving to the hotel in anticipation of staying in some \"by the hour hotel\" but had the attitude that when you're in New York you should only be spending a minimum of time in your hotel room. We arrived at 5pm and there was only about 3 people in the queue waiting to be checked in so I started to feel better as some people say they have waited hours to check in. You're supposed to show your room key to a guy who sits by the elevators so that he can stop people who aren't guests going to the rooms but not once over our stay did these guys ever ask us to show him our key which kind of defeats the purpose of him being there. We found the elevators to be very quick and were never waiting more than 20 seconds for one. We were staying on the 7th floor and when we got off the elevator my concerns returned. The carpet looked like it was put down in the 70s and had numerous stains on it. It took us about 10 mins to find our room cause its like a rabbit warren on the floors. Eventually we found it and held our breath as we opened the weirdest looking door I have ever seen. They looked like something you'd see in a mental institution. The room was old but clean. The bathroom had seen better days as some of the enamel had chipped off the bath but the shower was warm and powerful. The air conditioning was non existant but luckily it wasn't that warm so its wasn't missed but that would be a big problem in july and august.

The basic foundation of any hotel should be: clean (hygienic), safe and value for money. With a budget hotel you cannot expect a swimming pool, fitness centre, room service and so on. You can however, even in the cheapest hotel, expect that rooms are well-cleaned and hygienic. The fact that hotel Penn. could only offer us rooms which contained mildew, heaps of dust, dirt and water/pee spots. Not to mention the presence of hair on the 'clean' sheets. The doors didn't appear to be burglar proof, but I immediately state that I am not an expert in this. Wallpaper was coming down at places in the hallway, it all looked shaby and unsafe. Strange, cause with its great location, this hotel could be a winner. It is however, not.

After a while of just sitting around, at about 4 AM, he decided to go home to get some sleep before he had to come back the next morning to be our tour guide again. It was just us three girls in the room. One friend slept on one bed and I shared with the other. I slept with my head at the foot end of the bed, so I could see the front door clearly. After being asleep for maybe an hour, I heard a slight noise coming from the door and somehow it woke me up. I lifted my head and a man was peeking his head in. With only a lap top light in the room, it was hard to tell what was going on, not to mention me being half asleep. I thought it might have been my friend coming back to stay with us because he missed his train. so I said, \"Is that you?\" the man stood there and looked at me for about 15 seconds, then he crept into the bathroom. I sat up and said quietly, \"there's someone in the room you guys.\" the girl I was in the bed with got up and said something. the friend in the other bed woke up and thought I was just hearing things, so she got up to look in the bathroom. she saw him and immediately started screaming, which started a chain reaction of screaming girls. we thought maybe someone would hear us and bust in to save us. he just sat in the bathroom. one of the girls went to call 911 and tried to turn on the lamp by the beds... it didn't work. we just dialed 0 to get the front desk. when someone finally answered, my friend said, \"THERE'S SOMEONE IN OUR ROOM, WE NEED HELP.\" she was told to \"hold on\" and while she was on hold, she heard the person who answered say, \"guess who it is.\" it took them at least 10 minutes to send someone from security up to the room. after about 3 minutes, my other friend used her cell phone to call NYPD. they got there just before the hotel's security arrived at our door. somewhere in between all this, the guy who snuck into the room snuck back out. the man from security, who was a little creepy-looking, seemed to have an attitude with us because we called the cops. so the real cops left and the man from security took us up to a different room going through some back elevators that were really creepy. the security man was asking us questions about the person and they decided it was probably housekeeping. excuse me? I didn't know housekeeping just walked into peoples rooms and had afros and wore neon orange t-shirts and jeans for uniforms! and apparently, the same thing had happened the night before because the lock on the door was broken! we had to call my friend to come back and stay in the new room with us because we were still so shooken up. needless to say, we were not charged for the night. we spent the rest of our nights with the friend who lives nearby. I was so scared the rest of our trip.

We stayed for 9 nights in january and despite the rain had a fantastic time! We read the terrible reviews and approached the hotel with a great deal of trepidation, however i can safely say that previous reviews were somewhat exaggerated and the hotel more than met our needs. We arrived and yes, did have to be moved from the first room we were placed in. As other reviewers have mentioned it was almost as though reception were testing us- with a small room that stank of smoke and looked out onto a brick wall. Once we complained about the first room we were moved to a perfectly adequate room that looked out onto Macy's! I am certain that if we had asked to be moved again we would have been given a better room but at the end of the day we were exhausted from travelling and settled on the 9th floor. Things to note- the location is fantastic. Madison Sq gardens just over the road- beware of the touts selling tickets outside the hotel- they are more or less the same price in the ground and guarenteed genuine. Macy's is literally two mins walk away- great for stocking up on shopping- tip for any brits visiting- if you visit the customer services desk they'll give you an overseas discount card (when you show your passport) allowing a further 15% discount off all purchses- well worth it! Hote is also just over the road from subway- saver for feet after you've been walking for hours. The empire state building is approx 5 mins walk from the hotel and times square 10 mins. This really was a great location as we found that we could walk down broadway to little italy and china town but could also walk uptown to MOMA, central park etc. Yes the room s aren't great but we had large TV, clean bathroom (free toiletries replaced every day) maid service was excellant- cleared up our shopping bags and misc rubbish every day. Bed was very small but hey, we were happy to cuddle! Tips for NYC- Zagat guide is great for searching out good restaurants, national history museam free in evenings- bargain! Bloomingdales v expensive compared to saks and macy's. You must take the free staten island ferry to statue of liberty- just as good as the trips. Be prepared for tipping everywhere. Don't take shampoo, shower gel etc,- it's riduculously cheap and comes in huge bottles over in states.

We were recommended this hotel by a Travel Agent who had stayed there previously so thought that it would be ok. We booked before reading the reviews on Tripadvisor which made me very apprehensive but I thought I would go with an open mind and as we were not expecting much being 2 star. We arrived about 2am Saturday Morning, to be told that we were allocated a room with only one bed, the receptionist managed to find us another room which was on the 17th floor. When the elevator doors opened we were very nervous, the corridor was poorly lit and need of redecoration. We eventually found our room (this hotel has over 1000 rooms & corridors are vast) the doors looked like a cross between coffins and fridge freezers..very strange. We dreaded opening the door to our room and rightly so. Albeit a very large room, it was a smoking room, which we had not requested, there were no ceiling lights, just bedside lights and table lamps, the curtains had long been ripped down, the blinds were hanging off and the nets were grey from smoke. The wallpaper was peeling off, there were no headboards, the ceiling looked water damaged with plaster peeling off etc and the bathroom walls and ceiling were covered with mold infested wallpaper. Positive note.. shower was powerful. As it was so late we decided to brave the night as the beds were clean and comfy. In the morning we headed straight to reception to complain. The clerk 'Yen' didn't seem at all surprised we were complaining, the only worrying thing was he couldn't find our booking, and he told us that floors 16 & 17 were closed and to come back after 1pm as he had no other rooms available. We went back, got given another room, on the 7th floor with one king bed! We thought if the room was better we would be willing to share... we said we would check it out first before accepting it...well the room was worse it was tiny no bath just a shower, even more mold, plaster was flaking off the walls, the bedcover was dirty and stained, so we went straight back. This time they found us a twin room which was acceptable, a little mold on the bathroom ceiling but this is due to the inadequate ventilation in the bathroom. The walls had scuff marks on them, but apart from that, a good room for a 2 star hotel, (looks like the standard room on the website but needs painting again, as these rooms were renovated 5 years ago, the clerks confirmed this and also that not all the floors were renovated and it is still undergoing renovation). When we were moving our stuff out of the original room we were talking to one of the cleaners she said that floor 17 was having all the furnture replaced and we shouldn't have been given this room in the first place. We told her that our new room was on floor 9 (981) and she said ah yes this is a lot better. The only problem was that we were above a building sight and they started work as early as 2am in the morning. Good view of the Empire States building though! My overall opinion is that the hotel is in a great & safe location, 5 minute walk to timesquare, we walked everywhere and at the end of the day, the beds were comfortable and clean and the room & bathroom was cleaned daily with fresh towels.

I stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania from Wednesday, March 30, 2005 and checked out on Saturday, April 2, 2005. You may be wondering why did I stay so long if I considered it awful. Because I was with a group of 21 people from Michigan that prepaid for the trip. This hotel came \"highly\" recommended from the travel agency in Michigan which went through an agency in New York. Not only will I ever go through the travel agency again, but I will shout to the rooftops not to stay at this hotel. Yes, the location was a good one, but you could easily walk to different locations because the streets are not long at all, or you could quickly catch a subway, bus, or cab to where you want to go. As far as I'm concerned, Vornado Realty Trust (the hotel owner indicated on their website) and the managers have no integrity. I say this because it is no way that they would stay at a place with blood-like stains on the floor, sink, and shower curtain, mold in the shower, rust on the vents, stains on the lamp shade and telephone, carpet that causes you to never walk barefoot, stained walls, peeling wallpaper in the hallway, duct tape keeping the hallway carpet together (in plain site), and decrepit doors. Not only was the entire room decrepit, but the entire floor was decrepit. Mind you, I was with 21 other people. There were three of us in the room. If you risk going to the Hotel Pennsylvania, view the rooms or floors first. They actually have crappy floors, meaning that all the rooms are similar by the floor. I was on the 3rd floor. My last day, after hearing that one of the people in my group went and complained for the 2nd time and insisted that the manager walk up with her to view the room that they placed her in after her first complaint, she finally received a decent room after initially being placed in a room that looked as if yellow crime scene tape should be placed around it (that is how she described it), we decided to take a look at her final room. It was very small, but cute. She had a bathtub and shower with minimal mold (I feel all hotels should pull out tile in the bathroom if they are not going to take the time to clean it properly). She had a cherry oak headboard and small entertainment center that held her television. She also had a clock/radio and refrigerator. It took her to complain two times in order to get a decent room. This room was located on the 6th floor. We were on the 3rd floor and had none of these things. And don't think it got better the higher you went because the 18th floor seemed crappy too. We walked around on a few floors as housekeeping was cleaning the rooms. Now the person that gave this hotel a decent review because they've stayed in crappier hotels, I feel sorry for him/her. But I have traveled on business for years and this was supposed to be a leisure trip so I'm assuming my expectations are either much higher or his/her expectations are lower because of the experiences. And since I travel so much, I will make sure that my previous employer and current employer know to stay away from this hotel. Yes, they have nice rooms, but Vornado Realty Trust should not be trusted. After returning home, I noticed that their website does not describe the amenities in the Standard rooms. This seems to be the \"type\" of room that we had. On the site, the pillows on the bed are covering up the fact that you do not have a headboard and that the walls are stained. You also do not see the bathroom for these \"standard\" rooms. And the lighting is not an accurate account on the website compared to what was our reality. Stay away, stay away, stay away. And if you have invested in Vornado Realty Trust, you are investing with a company that has no integrity. On the home (main) page of their site, in the second paragraph, they state \"Inside of New York's Hotel Pennsylvania, you'll find beautifully renovated rooms, with new furniture and carpeting, a work desk with reading lamp, large color televisions, AM/FM clock radios, telephones with voice mail, individual AC and climate control are only featured in select New York City hotels.\" We should have assumed \"compared to what.\" Well, we found out it that it was compared to the crappy rooms that they have. Read between the lines. You will find these renovated rooms, but you may not get one. This is an integrity issue displayed on their website. On the Accommodations page, it states in the second paragraph \"The comfort and security of our guests are always important to us.\" Maybe the security because they have a security guard by the elevators, but definitely not the comfort. We were guests and our comfort did not seem to be important because they would not have placed us in a room like that. Again, proving their lack of integrity. I was not comfortable enough to step in the shower barefoot, therefore I constantly called housekeeping to bring extra towels, lay them in the shower and on the bathroom floor in order to avoid contact with any surface. And if I did, I would rewash that spot that touched the surface. Does that seem comfortable? We were so uncomfortable that we avoided the room as much as possible. The only good thing I have to say about the staff is that the man that brought me extra towels each morning seemed nice and the lady in housekeeping that I called to request for the towels would say \"right away mam.\" Also, the people at the information desk seemed nice and helpful. We would sit in the lobby if we knew we were not going right up to bed. And now that I think about it, maybe I can assume that most of the people that sat in the lobby had rooms on at least the 3rd and 18th floor (the crappy floors that we saw). We were not comfortable at all. This is still fresh in my mind and although my description may seem over-the-top, we were the ones that stayed there.", "Date": "April 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cworst hotel rooms i've ever entered\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3331166", "Content": "This must be the worst hotel room I have experienced.

To give that room it's dues it ha really comfy beds and a great shower. The only problem was some peeling paint in the bathroom and the smell of smoke. However when you have bad jet lag and have been on a flight for 7 hours the last thing you want to deal with is problems with the hotel. I wouldn't stay in this hotel again.

It was great. Location great, service great, room great, people great!! We had room 319, 3rd floor. It was quiet, (apart from the ventilation humming outside, but after the first night it was kinda soothing) very clean, surprisingly fresh and it was cleaned everyday. Loads of towels replaced everyday too. The bathroom was very clean, and the shower was to die for. They say New York is the City that never sleeps, but if all you need is a shower and a kip, this hotel is ideal. We arrived at JFK on Thursday morning, 3rd Feb, and after a grueling hour getting through the arivals process, (JFK security was very intimidating, but reasuring in hindsight) we hopped onto a bus to Penn Station, (We booked in advance a transfer bus at --------------) Manhattan, that cost about $27 return. We checked into our room at the hotel about 1pm. They advertise that checking in time is 3pm, but they seem to be very flexible. They have security deposit boxes at the hotel, which you can hire for free. I would reccomend to ask about these as soon as you check in, they're taken very fast. I felt very reasured knowing my valuables we're safe every day. I even left most of my cash in the boxes and just took what I needed for the day. Left my passport in the box too, you can't be too careful. However, I must add that New York is a surprisingly safe place to be in the day, (and in the evening too) we had our cameras out and never got any touble, nor did we see any. You'll find NYPD all over the place, a cop at every corner. The security and the Zero Tollerance attitude in the city is very reasuring. We even used the Subway (which we were advised not to do) a few times in the evening and there was no trouble at all. Although, we did have a very amusing encounter with a blind man singing and dancing for some change, on the trains. We reccomend:- Empire State Building at night, Buying souvenirs from the tiny shops in Time Square, between west 48th and 50th Sts (we found T-Shirts 7 for $10, bargain!) However, try to avoid the shop owned by the Chinese man, he will try to confuse you by going into silly tales about silver, gold and five fingers (???), very amusing, but the shop next door will give you an extra t-shirt for your $10. Ellen's Stardust Diner, corner of Broadway and west 51st St (singing waiters and waitresses! Pay for dinner and get free entertainment New York style!) And watching the squirrels in Central Park, (if you share the same sense of humour as I have, you'll find this entertainment hillarious!) You should aviod:- Applebees Restauraunts. There are two of these restauants in Midtown, and we had a very horrible dinner at the one on west 42st and it was appalling! We received inexcuseable service, which they had a cheek to charge us 18% Gratuity for, and the food was unfit for human consumption. I ordered the Chicken and Cheese and it might as well have come swimming in vegetable fat. Very gross! All in all, we had a very memorable holiday and would reccomend this hotel to anyone, especially couples with no quarms about discount accommodation.

Room was cleaned daily although personally I had the quickest daily shower possible as the bath was old and rusty! On the plus side the lady at the expedia desk was really helpful in getting us theatre tickets and it certainly didn't spoil what was a marvellous first stay in New York. Fortunately having read the reviews on this site we were prepared for the worse but the lesson is that this hotel is too much of a lottery so in future we'll pay more for a better hotel.

Our sales rep was skeptical of booking there, and did not want to put us up at a \"flea bag\" hotel. Took train from Baltimore to Penn Station. Walked across the street, checked in (no line, no wait) about 6pm. Nice lobby. Took elevator to our rooms. (sorry, cannot remember floor #, but rooms were definitely the \"Superior\" King rooms a la the web photos) Rooms were clean, all amenities I needed. Bathroom was small, (CLEAN, no hair no mold) but I had a hair dryer and makeup mirror so who's compaining! I had a King size bed, DRAPES over the window (although, I do have to admit that I too had one the \"windows that would not shut\", but it was only open about 3\" and it was a warm Nov night) Carpet clean, TV worked fine (watched election coverage till 11:30 was too depressed to continue.) and to be honest, in retrospect, the room looked almost identical to web photo(s) Adding to that, I have to say, the MOST COMFORTABLE hotel bed I've slept on in a long time. We ate dinner directly off of the lobby at Lindy's. Too expensive and I wouldn't do it again. Walked off dinner and ended up near Rock Center and back. Beautiful evening for a stroll. Got back to room about 10:30pm. (location, location, location!) Next morning we checked out. We also had them hold our luggage (cost me about $3; definitely worth not carrying our bags with us AND we were just across the street from the Penn Station) All in all, not bad. Granted, it wasn't money out of my wallet, but I've stayed in far worse, for more$$. As a matter of fact, I am planning on returning with family in tow.

Having read previous reviews I was quite nervous about staying there and had in fact contacted my travel agent well in advance who assured me that they have been booking people into this hotel for years and have never had a complaint! We arrived on Friday 4th December 2004 at approximately 2.00pm. There was a long line for checking in but it moved along nicely. I had booked two rooms, one for my husband and myself and the other for my two grown up children. When my husband and myself went to our room we nearly died. Black net curtains on windows, curtains falling down, blinds broken. The carpet was covered in stains of an unknown nature, cigarette burns and bleach stains. Bedspreads were filthy and covered in stains as well. The plaster was peeling off the walls. The bathroom was full of black mold. It was truly awful. The other room wasn't much better. We went down to reception and like other reviewers they agreed to change the rooms without any protest. We were given the key to a new room and said we'd look at it on the condition that we would then decide what room we would stay in. However, our names were taken off the system immediately and while we were in our original room dicussing what to do a German gentleman and his son came in and wanted to know what we were doing in their room!! The second set of rooms that we checked out were a bit better than the original rooms but they were still not up to any standard. When we told the gentleman on reception this he told us to contact our travel agent - this was at 5.00pm which was 10.00pm at home!!. We took the new rooms. Our room was clean but it was very very hot. After we had settled in I noticed that the window was open I tried to close it but soon discovered that it wouldn't close. I requested that it be fixed but needless to say it wasn't. As it happened because of the heat in the room if it wasn't open we probably would have roasted. There were no curtains in the room only a torn blind so once it got to 5.30am it was impossible to sleep with the noise of the traffic!!. The room that the children ended up in was really awful. Again no curtains and there was blck mold in the bathroom and behind their beds. The plaster was also peeling off the walls in their room. They were so fed up that they decided to take the room but my daughter didn't sleep the first night as she was so nervous. We ended up having a great time but when you are going away for only a few days you do not want to spend the first 2/3 hours of your holiday traipsing around from room to room and then settling for something that you would never stay in at home. There must be some body in America that polices hotel accommodation. Don't get me wrong I did not expect the Ritz. I knew that this was a very basic hotel but there's a difference between basic and falling apart!

The line moved quickly and we were dealt with by a very nice lady who greeted us with a smile and pleasant service.

We were very happy with the room, it was clean, bright, the bathroom was also clean, the room had a large king bed, very comfortable - although the room wasn't huge it was very adequate and as we had not paid Waldorf prices, we were happy. The location of this hotel is one of the best I have ever stayed in, especially if you are a shopper like me. Very convenient almost at Macy's front door. The only problem we had during our stay is that we were supplied with one pillow only and my husband likes to sleep with two pillows. We did ring up housekeeping who told us that she would put us on a list but that they did not have any as the hotel was full. I told her not to worry as Kmart had plenty and we went around the corner and bought one - end of problem. On the day of check out we organised express check out with the desk clerk early in the morning, he very kindly arranged for us to hold our room until 2.00 pm even though check out was at 12.00 - so we could shower just before leaving for the airport and return flight to Ireland. Our experience with the hotel Pennsylvania was fine. It is not a luxury hotel but then you are not paying luxury prices. Once you stay in a refurbished room you should have no problems.

When we arrived at our room on the 6th floor (room # 624!), to say we were disgusted and upset would be an understatement! The room was tiny, in a very bad state of repair, and absolutely stunk of cigar smoke. We weren't putting up with this, so I went back downstairs to the front desk, explained the disgusting nature of the room, and the receptionist was very understandable, and put us in another room. As this was on a Saturday night, the availability of rooms was very limited, so the receptionist said if our replacement room wasn't acceptable, then to put up with it for one night, and then ask for another replacement on the Sunday, when many of the guests would have checked out leaving more rooms available. When we reached our replacement room, the anticipation/trepidation was like that in a horror movie scene, when you're not quite sure what awaits you behind the door! Luckily, the room they'd given us had been renovated, was very comfortable, and had a Queen sized bed. However, the fact the main room had been renovated couldn't also be said of the bathroom! It was in a pretty bad state, but at the end of the day, if you're worried about the state of a room you spend hardly anytime in, then perhaps you should be booking into the Ritz! There was hot water at all times though, but the shower must have been designed with people who stand less than 5 foot high in mind! I'm over 6 foot tall, and had to significantly crouch when having a shower! When we returned to the hotel for the last 2 nights of our trip, we specifically asked the receptionist for a renovated room again, and on this occasion, we couldn't have been given a better room. It was a very spacious corner room on the 11th floor (# 1169 if you want to ask for it!), very well decorated, the bathroom was very nice (with a nicely positioned shower head!), and the room also had a good size desk, as well as 2 sofa chairs with foot-rests. However, the real bonus was when we opened the curtains, and had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. For this part of the stay, we'd give the hotel 5 stars, but based on our experiences first time round, we'd give it a 1 rating. So overall, we have to say this hotel is only average.

Our room was small and yes the wallpaper was discoloured with age, the paintwork needed a wipe and the carpet had seen better days but overall the room was clean. The blankets were clean and the sheets brilliant white with no suspect stains. Our bedding was changed three times during our 5 night stay. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and we had plenty of clean, fluffy white towels which were changed daily. Our shower curtain was clean and you could tell it had been changed for our stay. We did not have a magnificent view of New York from our window but then again we were only in our room to sleep and shower. The window had a blind, nets and curtains so we definitely had privacy.

The only thing we would say against the hotel is the price of breakfast in the Joe O's restaurant. It is expensive compared with cafes etc outside of the hotel. We went to the Bagel Maven Cafe (just along the street from Penn Station) everyday for breakfast and paid half of what the hotel charged. The cafe even do great takeouts. The hotel is in an excellent location. Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens, Macy's and the Empire State Building are right on the hotel's doorstep. Times Square, Broadway and other main attractions are within easy walking distance. Overall we would say that the hotel is fine and do not be worried about the bad reviews on this site.

The pea green paint continued and the flickering light only made the shabbyness of the room more apparent. The one chipped and stained lamp did not work and the curtains and bed linen looked like they'd seen better days. The bathroom looked like ones that you would see in the tenement buildings of an old late 70's/early 80's movie.

Those doors with the bulges once served a purpose. When we were there, we were curious and opened the panel on our door. Inside, there was a shelf and some paperwork. On closer inspection, we found that the shelf was for a pair of shoes. You put your shoes in there, filled out the paperwork, put a tag on the doorknob and someone would come along, take the shoes and get them shined! I'm sure that service has long since disappeared. This was once a grand hotel. It's original name was the Hotel Pennsylvania, as it is now. Before staying there, we heard the big band song, Pennsylvania 6-5000. When we checked in, we noticed that number on the phone. I asked my father, who grew up in NYC, if the song was about the hotel and he told me that, yes it was. I see that the hotel still uses that phone number. Anyway, after the Statler, it became the Hotel Penta, and now uses the original name. From the descriptions, it sounds like the furniture is still the same as it was when we stayed there--and believe me, it wasn't exactly new when we were there!

After getting out of the elavator I was expecting to be hit by an awful smell. This was not the case though. There was a faint old smell, but nothing that would bother you. When getting to the room I was again expecting the worse, but instead was met by a large clean room. Sure it wasn't perfect (small amounts of mould in the bath, wet carpet by the air conditioning, leakinging sink and part of the blind was falling down) but it was bearable. The blind and sink both were fixed during the week with out us having to complain and it was visable that the cleaner had attempted to get the mould stains out of the bath as there was very little left by the end of the week. The shower was extremely powerful and the air conditioning worked well. There were two windows in the room and one in the bathroom all of which we were able to open. Fair enough the windows and the carpet were dirty, but not so it was unbearable. It was obvious that the cleaner vacumed at least twice a week and the towels were changed daily. The cleaning staff were always friendly. The latest the room was ever cleaned was 5pm and if you are in the room the cleaners ask what you want cleaning. There is also a gym on the 18th floor that is free to guests and open 24 hours a day (you use your room card to open the door to gain access). If you ever are short of towels there is a huge supply in the fitness room. I would definatley stay at this hotel again. The imperfections aren't major and don't spoil your holdiay, after all you won't be in the room very often. Next time I may take a rennovated room to see the difference between the two.

You must keep in mind that you are visiting NYC therefore any hotel under $200/night will not be luxury accommodations, if that's what you are looking for you will need to shell out the $$. However, if you are looking for a decent priced, clean hotel that is full of history, meets a traveler's basic needs & is in an excellent location, then Hotel Pennsylvania will be a fine choice. I found the hotel interesting because it was like stepping back in time, the famous Glen Miller song \"Pennsylvania 6-5000\" was written about this hotel, it is also one of the 5 largest hotels in Manhattan. Because Hotel Pennsylvania is so large & popular, the lobby is very busy & you will most likely experience a longer check in wait then you would at most hotels. The room we stayed in was one of the \"non- renovated\" rooms which was fine; it was a large, clean room with vintage furniture that seemed to be the original furniture from back in the day; we also had a great view of Manhattan. I like to think of it as staying in a well preserved 1940's hotel, you can picture all of the greats from the Big Band era who used to frequent this hotel wandering the halls, having a great time in NYC.

I suppose the one good thing was that when we got there I was expecting the worst - and that was what we got. Having checked in we went in the lift to our room on the third floor. As soon as the lift doors opened the smell hit us - it was terrible - like it hadn't been cleaned for years. However as we knew we were only going to be in the corridors for a short amount of time each day, we tried to over look it and proceeded to our room. Walking down the corridors, the carpets were stained, as were the walls, in addition to which the doors of the rooms were mouldy and broken - I can now also see what other tripadvisors meant when they said the doors looked like coffins. When we found our room it was dark and dingy, the beds hadn't been made and there was used towels all over the bathroom. I felt quite sure this would happen - it would seem it happens to most people. We then went back to reception where we were allocated a new room, but recieved no appolgy for the state of the original room. When we got to the new room on floor seven, the room was notabley better, which seems unfair on those who are on lower (worse) floors and have paid the same price. However, this is not to say that our room was nice, although the lighting was better, the main lamp did not work. I notice some people have commented that they had stained curtains - we didn't even have curtains. The bathroom was by far the WORST part of the hotel, there was a hole in the ceiling, the bath was literally flaking away, and it was hit or miss as to whether or not our water was BROWN. In terms of the staff, some were very friendly and helpful, others weren't - either way do not always trust what they tell you as we were informed that the shuttle bus back to the airport would take about a hour/hour and a half tops - it took over two. I would also recommend to avoid the rip off prices in the shop, a few stamps, a drink and a chocolate bar cost me $14.

In the old days, if you had clothing to be cleaned, you would place your clothes inside the door and then the porter could retrieve them from the hallway side of the door. Interesting, but still ugly. I found our room to be large enough and it was quiet. There is some shabbiness, but it was clean enough for me. We had maid service every day and received clean towels.

Hotel lost 2 out of the 6 bookings and we were told that it was between us and our travel agent.ACTUAL REVIEW When my party of 6 first arrived and waited to check in in the Lobby, we thought how fantastic it looked! Then it all went downhill. Firstly, the hotel did not have all our names - only 4 of us were booked in and although we had the proof, we were told it was between us and our travel agents. Then there weren't enough rooms available because they were still being cleaned. Myself and my friend were able to go to our room because it was ready and left the others downstairs. Our room (224) was awful beyond belief. The adjoining door to whoever's room next door was open and the only way to shut it was to apply force, ie a run up using my shoulder to slam it shut. It then wasn't lockable so I wedged a chair under the door knob and we also used our cases to block it too. In the meantime our friends had been put up in the so called \"Presidential Suite\" which was just as bad! Peeling paper, dirty carpets and furniture, exposed wiring, a hole to the outside wall barely covered by a piece of plywood sums up the decor. We then decided to go out for a quick drink. Me and my friend went back to our room, had showers etc and settled down to sleep thinking, we'll make the best of this, we're only sleeping here. We just dropped off and then our door opened!! Fortunately the chain was on as there were 2 drunk men trying to get into our room! I phoned security and at first they said that we weren't in our room, we should be in the Presidential Suite! Then they said there was no way that the men could have got in our room and I then got a bit upset as they most certainly had. The explanation was that the men should have gone to 224a but as I then pointed out, how come our room was enabled if they should have had a completely different one! Me and my friend did not feel safe staying in our room so we told reception we were moving to the Presidential Suite and that their security was disgusting. We then had to wake up our friends to get into the suite. However, there were no spare beds there. We asked for 2 put up beds and bedding 3 times and got none. We asked for coffee and only got 2 cups as apparently only 2 of our party were distressed. When one of my friends went downstairs to complain to reception that 2 men were given access to a room with 2 girls in it the reply was it was a mistake anyone could have made. Also, the receptionist commented that I had told them that everything was ok now. It certainly wasn't! The only member of staff who has customer service skills is Harry - he's lovely. The rest of them don't give a toss. The next day we spoke to the manager who apologiesed and said bedding and beds whould be in the room that day. They weren't. We had to phone down at least twice to get these. The heaters in the suite only worked for 1 day. We asked for portable heaters - they never arrived. However when we did complain it was implied by the manager that we were lucky to have the Presidential Suite - yeah right. Whilst staying at this hotel, we met someone who had moved rooms 4 times, another whose ceiling had collapsed on them and another who had green mould in the bath.

There are a lot of negative reviews on here, some may be true and some may just be picky! If you are planning on a budget trip to New York to see all the main attractions and saving money on accommodation then you can?t go far wrong with this hotel. Yeah it is an old hotel (1914 I think) and it does have 1700 rooms so what can you expect a lobby to be like with that many guests staying? When we arrived at the hotel it was approx 9pm on a Saturday. After a long flight with 1 stop in Philadelphia all we wanted to do was to check in and get to our room. There was no queue for the check in and it was processed quickly by a very helpful member of staff. We where given a room on the 5th floor (501A). When we exited the lift on this floor it just reminder me of the corridors from the film the shining (which I thought was quite funny!) but it was clean and no trace of a damp smell which I had read about on here! On entering the room it was (for the price) a standard room. The room was clean, a very large bed, fresh bed linen and the bathroom had been also cleaned with fresh towels. There was also a large 34 inch TV in the corner which came to good use after tiring long walks through the city. A wall mounted air conditioner always kept the room nice and warm too! There was also a fridge in the room which helped when to cool those refreshments after the long day. Over the 5 nights/days the room was well kept and new sheets every couple of days were done by the cleaner who always said hello when passing! (Would you like to clean 1700 rooms on minimum wage). The location of the hotel is the best you could ask for. For all those sports fans (like me) Madison Square Garden across the road. Shopping, Macy's was next door but one. Empire state building was around the corner a 10 minute walk and Times Square/Broadway was 600/800m away, again a 15 minute walk. Subways were always close by and a taxi rank over the road. You can't ask for more than that! The only complaint that we do have is due to the age of the hotel, there was a lack of water pressure between 8 and 9.30 in the morning. The shower was a bit cold. BUT the hot water out of the taps was still available. It took 1 minute to fill a bath, just as quick as a shower! All in all we had a really great time and we would go back to this hotel again.

It was big and busy so I was still hopeful! We checked in quickly and made our way up to our room on the 15th floor. As soon as we stepped from the lift I got a taste of things to come. It was nt too bad, just looked dated and a bit rough around the edges. As we approached our room I was noticing the doors they were terrible, dirty, tatty and very old fashioned. Nevermind I thought, lets just get in there. We opened the door and the smell that hit us was attrocious. The window was wide open despsite the temperature outside being minus to try and mask the smell. To be honest there was nothing good about the room. The carpet was dirty, the wallpaper was thick with grime and hanging off the walls, the ceiling was yellow and the paint was peeling. The curtains and nets were also thick with grime and very dirty, there is too many things to mention. It was late by then so there was nt much we could do, we just got into bed (which thankfully was clean). In the morning I had a fuzzy head from the smell so we went to see our friends room. Although theirs was as tatty as ours at least it did nt smell. As we knew it was just ours we asked reception to change. We were told we could but would need to ask again after 3pm. When we came back to do this we were told under no circumstances could this happen because there had been a flood and 40 rooms had been affected. The man was stressed as he had alot of people to deal with but he was sarcastic with me when I told him why we were unhappy. He said to me 'Madam, this is only a 2* hotel you know' I was well aware of that and basic I dont mind but dirt and smells are unacceptable. We had a further 2 nights in this room and were very unhappy. We had some lovely days out but felt really down when we had to come back to the hotel. There was no chance of having a mid day lay down or a lie in, we could nt wait to get out. We were lucky that it was an active holiday. We finally found out what the smell was when we heard a dog barking down the corridoor. Animals in a hotel!!! what on earth is that about!!? That is gross. It was also obviosuly a smoking room and years and years of dog smells and smoke had built up to stink out this foul room. The only good things in the hotel were its location and the housekeeping-the beds and towels were always clean. The rest was a disgrace I had to buy slippers so I did nt put my feet on the dirty carpet, I had to sleep fully clothed as it was so cold with the window open and we had to buy air freshner to attempt to hide the smell!!

The rooms are small and dingy, and are in desperate need of refurbishment. However, we knew the hotel was a basic 2* hotel, and we got what we paid for. There is no better location on the island - a 5 minute walk to Times Square, 20 mins to Central Park and 2 minutes from Macy's and the Empire State Building. Madison Square Garden is directly opposite the hotel, although I would recommend taking the subway to the financial district - it's a good hour-and-a-half walk. We applied for a New York Greeter before we travelled, and I would highly recommend this free service. Hara met us and showed us around Soho, Chinatown and Little Italy - all of which are worth seeing even though it is off the tourist track. I would advise going to the Empire State Building first thing in the morning if you don't want to face long queues, and try to pick a clear day. Ground Zero is eerily quiet amidst all of the noise in adjoing streets, and is worth visiting not as a tourist attraction but more to pay tribute to the people who lost their lives on September 11th. New Yorkers will talk about the events of the World Trade Centre attacks quite openly, although you can sense that there is not a day that goes by without them remembering something about that day. Drinks are pricey ($14 for a small wine and a pint of Guinness!!!), as are most restaurants as you would expect from a major city. Ice skating in Central Park is extortionate but worth it for the experience, and visit the zoo ($6) whilst you're there. Christmas time is magical in New York, but take plenty of warm clothes - the wind chill is biting cold.

We stayed in the Hotel Pennsylvania from 8-11 January 2004. When I checked this website for reviews I was shocked at what I read. I was very worried about whether I would be staying in some sort of cess pitt. We arrived and was very impressed with the look of the place, the lobby is huge, there wasn't much seating though. I read lots of stories about queing for hours to check in. We arrived about 1800 ready for a long wait, but there was only about 4 people queing. We queued for about 10 mins before seeing a receptionist. She was polite and quickly gave us our room key. Room 706. I agree with the comments about the 'shining' corridors, I expected Jack Nicholson to be lurking somewhere. We got in the room and there was someones luggage still in the room. We called reception and was told to come straight back down. Here we go I thought. We went back down and was given 722. Now when we arrived at 722 I have never been so nervous at entering a hotel room before. What was behind the door?? We opened it up and was pleasantly suprised at the room, It was massive, with 2 double beds all with clean bedding, walk in wardrobe and tv. The bathroom was very clean. The decor was dated, bit of wallpaper peeling and a few stains in one of the corners, but hey nothing like I had read about. The carpet was also fine, no dirt, or cockroaches. The room was warm and we had a heater in-case we needed to turn it up. First thing when I woke up the next morning was the hot water situation. I had read many stories of no hot water. Turned on the shower and hot water poured out, same with the sink. The maids tend to turn up at around 0930. I get the impression that if you are in your room when they come, they wont come in, probably till the next day. We made sure we was out before then anyway...we were in New York!!, can't see much laying in bed. We got new bedding and towells every day, all were clean and fresh. To top it off I don't think you can beat the location, its great. Basically a 5 min walk or under to everything. Macy's is 1 min away and there is a few pizza resturants and a mcdonalds on the next block for quick eats. All in all I would say that I had a enjoyable stay in the Hotel Pennsylvania. It sounds like I got very lucky with everything but there are good rooms in there. Remember you probably won't have paid much for the accomodation. I paid about $70 a night, so don't expect the Ritz, with picassos on the walls. I wish you good luck, and remember a good room is there.

However it went downhill from there. We complained about the first room we were given on the 4th floor, the room a 'superior king size room' was disgusting, it was cramped, dusty, the carpet was filthy, and the bathroom must have been built for a midget and had very suspicious stains in the bathtub. The second room no 736 was bigger, but not much, had a king size bed with a newish bed cover and a cleaner bathroom. However the carpet looked as though it had never been hoovered. We weren't happy but the hotel was full due to thanksgiving, so we conceded as long as the carpet was vacuumed, which the guy in the grey suit (looked inportant) said he would sort for us. This didn't happen so I called housekeeping and still it wasn't sorted so when we got back from our meal on the evening, I spotted one of the maids on our floor and asked if I could use the hoover, she obliged and at least afterwards we could walk around without our shoes on. We also had a wonderful experience with 'Cyril' the cockroache, i couldn't work out whether he arrived in the bathroom via the plughole or via the hole in the bathroom ceiling. We'd also love to know if anyone is planning to stay here soon if the 3 jelly babies are still on the floor by the lifts on the 7th floor? On the plus side though, the location is great, it didn't take us long to check in and out, and we did have fresh towels every day and the bed was changed daily.

As people said before, the lobby is good and there is ample seating for a hotel lobby i believe although it did get crowded some days. We arrived at about 12-1pm and were afriad we'd be sat around as it said on some reviews that we werent allowed to check in before 3pm. We went straight u to the desk and checked in. It took about 15 minutes to queue and to actually check in. Then we went to our room on the 14th floor. The room was basic, it had a double bed, a TV, a cupboard and a chest of draws. The bed was clean and was changed daily. People who said their bed didnt get changed, you can request this by calling the number PROVIDED to you on your check in, although we didnt have to. The room itself was pretty clean looking and there were no sign of the black curtains or the brown stains on the walls anywhere (as other people reported on this site). There is no food offered in the hotel, lindys is based in the hotel but is expensive. The next block over, you have an italian resaurant, a greek restaurant, a subway restaurant, a Mcdonalds, a chinese restaurant, a help yourself to all different kinds of food (very cheap and very good food) restaurant. They are all in a row. Once we found them, we never ate at lindys again. As people have said, location is awesome, across the street from Madison square garden, you are literally 20 yards from the red line 1+9 subway entrance and over the road from penn station. The information desk is really helpful. They book tickets, and answer any general questions about NYC or the hotel in general. The check in desk also acts as a cashier and you are allowed to cash cheques up to $100 per room free of charge which was for travellers cheques. Also someone complained about the New York airport service, saying they dropped them off so many blocks from the hotel. What happens is they drop you off at grand central station, and then you transfer to another NYAS bus which drops you off outside of the restaurants i mentioned before (20 yards from your hotel door).

Reception was busy, queued for ten mins,and a not particularily pleasant woman checked us in. Security to the lifts was good, and the elevators had cameras and Tv screens showing CNN.

After fiddling with our electronic key, we pushed open the heaviest metal door ever, passing graffiti on the wall \"I want your money\" It was a large room with 2 beds and a bathroom with a bath and shower. The thing that dissapointed us was that the websites we had seen had described the hotel as being refurbished. We found out that the pictures are of mainly superior and business class rooms, and not what you get for budget (\u00a358 per night.)which plainly have not been refurbished. The bath was badly chipped and had been painted! the toilet had the slowest weakest flush I have ever seen, but best was the hairdryer that was positioned so close to the sink that you could easily knock it when washing?? The shower worked and we had hot water. The closet had not been cleaned, the ironing board was filthy, and the carpet was stained throughout. There was a bloodied band aid on one of the beds, and one bed had crumbs all over it. The lighting was poor, we had a window but this looked into the side of the front of the hotel, (other rooms) and the window opened, with great difficulty to be governed by a wire allowing it only to open 6 inches?? The curtains were black mouldy and stained. The colour tv worked, (fab choice) but there were wires exposed everywhere all over the room and holes where gawd only knows what lurked within. We complained at the desk and were told the hotel was full, but \"Harry\" was really nice, and let us see another room, but to our horror this was the tiniest room ever with a huge mould patch growing up the wall. We decided to stay in ours. We werent in NYC to stay in our room and it was safe, cleaned everyday, fresh sheets, towels etc, and a bonus, it was quiet, no noisy neighbours or street sounds. I wouldnt neccesarily stay again and by some of the other reviews it looks like we were lucky, however if you want budget location, and are willing to take a gamble as to what sort of room you get, then this is the place.

Before booking we viewed their website and the hotel & rooms looked clean and tidy.However on arriving at the hotel at about 11pm at night we where dropped off at the side entrance which looked like a run down building. We managed to find our way to the marble cladded lobby and we breathed a sigh of relief because it looked nice and exactly matched what we had seen on their website previously. This however was short lived once arrived at our room as I have never seen such a dull, shabby and dirty hole in all our travelling. The bed linen and walls were dirty and the fridge whined and smelled. The bathroom was shabby with a hole and mould on the ceiling. Our view through the window was other hotel windows and the curtains where dirty. Its was now about 11.30pm at night and we complained to the management as we had asked for a room with a view that was clean. They told us that they only had another 1 room available and that we would have to speak to the manager in the morning. We were given another room but were told that it had not yet been refurbished. We nearly died when we arrived at this room. The door was smashed in and just about locked and another two doors lead to other rooms and didnt even lock. I managed to push a sofa against one to stop it opening. The curtains had a natural black tinge that had been amassed over years and again the bedsheets were filthy. The carpet was worn right through to the floor in certain areas and the bathroom was falling apart. It was now 12pm at night and we had no alternative but to sleep on our coats on top of the bed. I phoned our travel agent in the uk at about 4am and he arranged another room overlooking madison square garden which was better but again wasnt that clean and extremely basic. While we stayed there no one ever cleaned our room but only changed the towels every other day and the personnel were very unhelpful. Please be careful if you do chose this hotel as New York is a wonderful holiday and this hotel may spoil it for you. Please note We were also ripped off by a company called the new york airport service who kept us waiting for almost 45 mins at the airport after telling us we would only be there about 10 mins and also dropped us of in the middle of New York when they stated they would drop us of at our hotel this cost us $45. It cost us another $20 to get to the hotel from where they dropped us off. They didnt want to know ethier when i rung them up. My advice stay somewhere else and get yellow cabs everywhere cause they are cheaper, direct and easier to use.", "Date": "September 22, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leipzig, Germany", "Title": "\u201cNot sooo bad\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1273805", "Content": "We arrived at the Hotel Penn during the blackout on August 14th - it was a horrible place just like any hotel in NY at this time.

When they opened checkin again they gave us a room on 5th floor and a free glow-in-the-dark stick to find the room and a wise 'take care'. As electricity wasn't working water didn't work either and air condition was leaking so there was a big water stain on the floor. As electricity came back I can just say that for the price of $61 per person in a double room this was just great value. Rooms were clean and cleaned every day. Well the design is outdated green and grey can get youz into a depressive mood but you are not staying in NY to stay at the hotel. So we basically spent the nights there. Penn Station is across the street - The Empire State Building is a 5 minutes walk. Subway is around the corner - Saborro and McDonalds is right 1 minute away from the hotels doorstep.

That said, it must seem as though every reviewer stayed in a different room. In my case, I was on the 12th floor and I managed to check out other rooms when the housekeeper was doing her rounds. My room, and the other rooms, were fine. No stains, cracks in the ceiling or other problems. There were no bad odors and no cockroaches. Our room did not have the best decor, but it was EXCELLENT for the price! I think that some of the other reviewers were either (a) spoiled (b) in a really bad room below the renovated levels or (c) work for another hotel and are trying to make the HP look bad. Here are the facts. - I was in and out of chec-kin, and allowed to check in early. Same for check out. - 2 The elevators were speedy and cool. I could watch CNN on my way up and down. The facade and lobby are historic and cool.- 3 As a train buff, I was able to run across the street while my wife got ready and check out the subways and trains leaving and departing the station. It was awesome.- 4 The location was ideal and close to just about everything we needed.- 5 Our room smelled fine and though the view left much to be desired, we only used the room to sleep and change. We had clean bedding and towels. Everything was as it should be expected.-6 Cable TV was working properly. -7 For $85.00 a night, it was unbeatable. But remember - I got the upgrade and did not see the rooms below.-8 My brother in law stayed in a suite upstairs. That one DID have a stinky, stained carpet and refridgerator. The cieling was cracked. But it was huge and they were happy. - 9 If you're a person who cannot stand to be without fine decor, a fantastic view and beautiful acoomodations, fork over $1000 a night and stay somewhere else.- 10 If you are a frequent traveler, enjoy taking in sights instead of watching TV in your room, or are just there for a place to sleep, it's PERFECT.NOW all of this in mind, I did some undercover work before I went there and got one of the employees to admit that there ARE TERRIBLE ROOMS below the renovated levels, with cockroaches, cracks, odors, etc. So make sure you stay in the renovated area.
