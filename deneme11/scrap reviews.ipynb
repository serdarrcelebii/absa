       "[\"The idea of the film is essentially copied/plagiarized from Tom Hanks's 1988 hit Big, but is much worse in every possible way. The visual effects are cheap and lousy. Levi's performance is a disaster. The tones of the young Billy and the grownup Billy are not consistent. The buildup is too long, and the plot lacks credibility. The result is a mindless comedy that is neither funny nor with heart.\",\n",
       " \"Can't believe anyone would give this movie 10/10.\\nThe movie is childish to the enth degree, I know Its Shazam and it needs to be a little childish but it was like watching a preschool cartoon.\",\n",
       " \"This is terrible. Absolutely terrible. It's long, not funny (all the jokes in the trailers), and at the end amazingly boring.\",\n",
       " \"It's take ages to present the characters, the main villain is awful and I prefer not talk about that sidekick kid Freddy, probably the most annoying character in theaters for the last decade. And my god the CGI!! The demons are ugly and badly designed.\",\n",
       " \"This is so far the worst experience I had in a theatre. Don't waste you're time on this, this movie should have make it direct-to-DVD. Hopefully, this will be a massive flop à the box office (not even 350M WW to my opinion)\",\n",
       " \"Utter garbage. Worst DC movie to date, and there are a lot of them. I don't understand the high ratings? Are they all being paid to say it was awesome? Bc it was a joke. This looked and felt like a movie that would go starught to DVD. Or be better on Nickelodeon. The jokes were rusty and poorly delivered. The storyline was weak, and the CGI looked introductory level. We would've walked out, but it was a free screening for audience feedback and some of the producers were there in the back prepared to hand our forms on what we thought. My girlfriend and I were honest and said, RE-shoots are necessary or this film is doomed. Guess we were of the minority. Because now that it's out, somehow it's doing well at the box office. Blows my mind, rotten tomatoes has this any higher than a 40%. And they have it at a 93%! I'm convinced they're being paid. No doubt about it.\",\n",
       " \"Guess I had high expectation for this movie and really wanted to enjoy it but couldn't, I find it a bit annoying, may be the kids could love this but not for adults. In my opinion this is the worst DC movie and could not understand the 10 star ratings. First time, I wanted to walk out of the theatre as it felt this is such a waste of time. Aquaman and the rest of the DC movies are 10times better.\",\n",

       " 'What a waste of time and money...',\n",
       " \"There is an excuse for sitting through the first half of this movie, because occasionally there is some unintentional humour. The moment our hero is asked to touch the wizard's shaft, in all seriousness, being one. The arrival of the subway at an unexpected evil lair and someone in our cinema shouting 'Hamworthy Station', being another. But, really, this is the most embarrassing two hours you will ever spend in a cinema seat, if you brought a friend. or you are over 25 and have a brain. Awful. This film finally convinced me that my days watching big budget movies are over - they are now aimed at people who were born after I left university.\",\n",
       " \"Remember subtly?\\nThis film surely doesn't.\\nAnother script that was simplified for overseas viewing, and had to explain every joke and every moral message.\\nIn 'Big' Tom Hanks was a kid trying to be an adult, Zachary Levi chose to be an adult acting like a kid.\\nThat choice took all the heart out of Shazam.\\nWatching this film was like watching Jimmy Fallon skits in which he attempts to be a superhero over and over again.\\nAlso, Corey Haim's performance in Dream a Little Dream seems to have been ripped off and poorly copied.\\nNothing original, just a film made to make money.\\nIt's like Deadpool and Superman and Big all wrapped up into one.\\nExcept, bad.\\nREALLY bad.\",\n",
       " 'After 45minutes of sheer boredom, I walked out of this movie and saw Dumbo instead. As the honest reviewers have aptly noted, SHAZAM! is designed for younger children age 8-14. Older teenagers and adults will find this movie tedious, unimaginative, and hard to watch for more than 15 minutes. The reviewers who gave this a \"10\" are purposely fooling you; they likely were paid to do it. Don\\'t fall for this amateurish mess. I\\'ve seen better CG on cable. It\\'s not exciting, it\\'s not funny, it\\'s nothing!',\n",

It has a plot and humour that seems to be aimed at a younger audience but the viloence/scares and profanity seem aimed at an older audience. The only people I can see actually enjoying this are middle aged fanboys reliving their childhood comic book fantasies.\",\n",

It was boring, borderline offensive with the way they portrayed some characters, idiotically simplistic with the plot (those conclusions the characters got from basically no information is like wtf), and just all in all a terrible movie. It could have been soooo good and funny, but all the good parts were put into the trailer, with the rest of the movie dragging on forever. The number of bored sighs and flashes of phones when people kept checking their phone was more entertaining than anything on the screen. I wish I could have my money and time back.\",\n",

The effects for the movie look lower quality than what Prime has for The Tick (which is saying alot).\",\n",
